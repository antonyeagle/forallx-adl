\chapter{Extensionality}\label{s:Interpretations}

Recall that \TFL\ is a truth-functional language. Its connectives are all truth-functional, and \emph{all} that we can do with \TFL\ is key sentences to particular truth values. We can do this \emph{directly}. For example, we might stipulate that the \TFL\ sentence `$P$' is to be true. Alternatively, we can do this \emph{indirectly}, offering a symbolisation key, e.g.:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[P] Big Ben is in London
	\end{ekey}
But recall from §\ref{s:TruthFunctionality} that this should be taken to mean:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \TFL\ sentence `$P$' is to take the same truth value as the English sentence `Big Ben is in London' (whatever that truth value may be)
	\end{itemize}
The point that I emphasised is that \TFL\ cannot handle differences in meaning that go beyond mere differences in truth value.


\section{Symbolising Versus Translating: Extensional Languages}
\FOL\ has some similar limitations. It gets beyond mere truth values, since it enables us to split up sentences into terms, predicates and quantifier expressions. This enables us to consider what is \emph{true of} some particular object, or of some or all objects. But we can do no more than that. 

When we provide a symbolisation key for some \FOL\ predicates, such as:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[C] \gap{1} lectures on logic in Adelaide in Semester 2, 2018
	\end{ekey} 
we do not carry the \emph{meaning} of the English predicate across into our \FOL\ predicate. We are simply stipulating something like the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item `$C$' and `\gap{1} lectures on logic in Adelaide in Semester 2, 2018' are to be \emph{true of} exactly the same things. 
	\end{itemize}
So, in particular:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item `$C$' is to be true of all and only those things which lecture on logic in Adelaide in Semester 2, 2018 (whatever those things might be).
	\end{itemize}
This is an indirect stipulation. Alternatively we can stipulate predicate extensions directly. We can stipulate that `$C$' is to be true of Antony Eagle and Jon Opie, and only them. As it happens, this direct stipulation would have the same effect as the indirect stipulation. But note that the English predicates `\blank\ is Antony Eagle or Jon Opie' and `\blank\ lectures on logic in Adelaide in Semester 2, 2018' have very different meanings!

The point is that \FOL\ does not give us any resources for dealing with nuances of meaning. When we interpret \FOL, all we are considering is what the predicates are actually true of. For this reason, I say only that \FOL\ sentences \emph{symbolise} English sentences. It is doubtful that we are \emph{translating} English into \FOL, for translations should preserve meanings.

 The \define{extension} of an English expression is just the things to which it actually applies. So the extension of a name is the thing actually named; and the extension of a predicate is just those things it actually covers. Our symbolisation keys can be understood as stipulating that the extension of an \FOL\ expression is to be the same as the extension of some English expression. 

English is not an extensional language. In English, there is a distinction between the extension of a term – or what it \emph{denotes} – and what it \emph{means}. While the predicate `\gap{} is a monotreme' and the predicate `\gap{} is either an echidna or a platypus' have the same extension, and apply to the same creatures, they are not synonymous. For one thing, you can replace an expression being used in a sentence by one of its synonyms, and the resulting sentence will mean the same thing as the original – and will have the same truth value. But while `Necessarily, all monotremes are monotremes' is true, `Necessarily, all monotremes are either echidnas or platypuses' is not true. There are extinct species of monotreme, such as \emph{Steropodon}, that are neither. Since there were monotremes that are neither platypus nor echnidna, that must be possible. So despite having the same current extension, these expressions differ in meaning. We need more than just the extension of some English expressions to fix the truth value of an English sentence involving them. Another example might be provided by singular terms. `Scott Morrison' and `the prime minister' share their extension, but differ in meaning: `Always, Scott Morrison will be prime minister' is false, but `Always, the prime minister will be prime minister' is trivially true. This difference in meaning is particularly evident when they are embedded in more complex constructions. 


In \FOL, by contrast, the substitition of one name for another with the same extension will always yield a sentence with the same truth-value; likewise with the substitution of one predicate for another with the same extension. This is normally summed up by saying that \FOL\ is an \define{extensional language}. An extensional language is one where \emph{non-logical} expressions with the same extension can always be swapped for one another in a sentence without changing the truth value.\footnote{What this shows, in passing, is that \FOL\ lacks the resources to express things like `\gap{} has always been \gap{}' or `\gap{} is necessarily \gap{}', which would allow us to separate expressions with the same present extension. 

Another construction with apparently similar effects is when a true identity, such as `Lewis Carroll is Charles Lutwidge Dodgson', is embedded in a belief report such as `AE believes that Lewis Carroll is Charles Lutwidge Dodgson'. The belief report appears to be false, if AE doesn't know that `Lewis Carroll' is a pen name for the Oxford mathematician. But still, this seems hard to deny: `AE believes that Lewis Carroll is Lewis Carroll'. Many have used this to argue that the meaning of a name in English is not just its extension. But this is actually a rather controversial case, unlike the example in the main text. Many philosophers think that the meaning of a name in English just is its extension. But let us be clear: no one generalises this to predicates. Everyone agrees that the meaning of an English predicate is not just its extension.}

We noted above that a name and a definite description might have very different meanings, despite having the same extension. Our treatment of definite descriptions (§\ref{subsec.defdesc}) allows us to preserve the extensionality of \FOL\ while also preserving the key logical features of descriptions. The definite description in English is analysed as a quantifier expression in \FOL, so there is no such singular term as a definite description in \FOL\ to be assigned an extension at all. What are assigned extensions are predicates and names, and our approach to definite descriptions allows the extensions of those predicates and names to fix the truth value of any symbolisation of an English sentence involving definite descriptions. The logical properties of the symbolised sentence in \FOL, however, are also determined by the quantifier structure, which isn't fixed by assigning an extension.



\section{A Word on Domains and Extensions}

We always start our symbolisation keys by specifying a domain, and with extensions in view we can see why this is important. If we are to interpret an expression in terms of what it applies to, then we are going to need to know what things are `out there' for it to apply to. As we said before (§\ref{sec_domains}), the only restriction we place on our domains is that they be nonempty collections of things. But every extension we assign will be drawn from the domain: every name will be assigned a member of the domain, and every one-place predicate will be assigned some things drawn from the domain. 

We can stipulate directly which things in our domain our predicates are to be true of. So it is worth noting that our stipulations can be as \emph{arbitrary} as we like. For example, we could stipulate that `$H$' should be true of, and only of, the following objects:
	\begin{center}
		David Cameron\\
		the number $\pi$\\
		every top-F key on every piano ever made
	\end{center}
Now, the objects that we have listed have nothing particularly in common. But this doesn't matter. Logic doesn't care about what strikes us mere humans as `natural' or `similar' (see below, §\ref{predrel}). As long as the extension assigned consists of elements of the domain, we've managed to come up with a acceptable interpretation, at least from a purely logical point of view.  Armed with this interpretation of `$H$', suppose I now add to my symbolisation key:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[d] David Cameron
		\item[n] Julia Gillard
		\item[p] the number $\pi$
	\end{ekey}
Then `$Hd$' and `$Hp$' will both be true, on this interpretation, but `$Hn$' will be false, since Julia Gillard was not among the stipulated objects. 

This process of explicit stipulation is just giving the extension of a predicate by a list of items falling under it. A more common way of identifying the extension of a predicate is to derive it from a classification rule that sorts everything into those items that fall under it and those that do not. Such a classification rule is often what people think of as the meaning of a predicate. But such a classification rule goes beyond the extension. In effect, our earlier symbolisation keys assign an extension by relying on our knowledge of the classification rule associated with English predicates. While the rule might determine the extension in a domain, it is not the extension: two different rules could come up with the same extension, as in the case of monotremes earlier. 

The extension of a one-place predicate is just some things. We can identify them by simply listing them. A list like that isn't anything more than the items in the list, so that list will be the same in every domain which contains those things in the extension. But we can see a further difference between extensions and classification rules when we can consider applying the same rule in different domains. So the classification rule associated with the English predicate `\gap{} is a student' applies to many many people in the domain of all people. In the domain `people in this class', it applies only to a select few. In fact, you can even use the classification rule `\gap{} is a student' to fix an extension where the domain doesn't include any students at all. In that case it will just yield an \define{empty extension} – one containing nothing. Here are some other cases where the empty extension should be assigned to a predicate:  \begin{itemize}
	\item `\gap{1} is a round square' (in any domain), or
	\item  `\gap{1} is a horse' in the domain of sheep, or
	\item `\gap{1} is divisible without remainder by \gap{2}' in the domain of prime numbers (where the number $1$ isn't normally thought to be a prime).
\end{itemize}

The empty collection too is a legitimate extension, because the empty set is still something: it is still a sub-collection of the domain. However, our names must always be assigned some element of the domain. An `empty' name would have no extension at all – and in an extensional language it is hard to see how we can admit such expressions. So keep clear the distinction between assigning an empty collection as an extension, and assigning nothing at all.  

There are also trivial cases of the opposite sort, where we assign the entire domain as the extension of a predicate: \begin{itemize}
	\item `\gap{1} is something' (in any domain), or
	\item `\gap{1} is a horse' in the domain of horses, or 
	\item `\gap{1} is greater than or equal to \gap{2}' in the domain consisting of just the number $1$ (the extension is \ntuple{1, 1}, which includes every ordered pair in this domain); and
\end{itemize}





\section{Many-place Predicates}
All of this is quite easy to understand when it comes to one-place predicates. But it gets much messier when we consider two-place predicates. Consider a symbolisation key like:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[L] \gap{1} loves \gap{2}
	\end{ekey}
Given what I said above, this symbolisation key should be read as saying:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item `$L$' and `\gap{1} loves \gap{2}' are to be true of exactly the same things in the domain
	\end{itemize}
So, in particular:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item `$L$' is to be true of a and b (in that order) iff a loves b. 
	\end{itemize}
It is important that we insist upon the order here, since love – famously – is not always reciprocated. (Note that `a' and `b' here are symbols of English, and that they are being \emph{used} to talk about particular things in the domain.)

That is an indirect stipulation. What about a direct stipulation? This is slightly harder. If we \emph{simply} list objects that fall under `$L$', we will not know whether they are the lover or the beloved (or both). We have to find a way to include the order in our explicit stipulation. 

To do this, we can specify that two-place predicates are true of \define{ordered pairs} of objects, which differ from two-membered collections in that the order of a pair is important. Thus we might stipulate that `$B$' is to be true of, and only of, the following pairs of objects:
	\begin{center}
		\ntuple{Lenin, Marx}\\
		\ntuple{Heidegger, Sartre}\\
		\ntuple{Sartre, Heidegger}
	\end{center}
Here the angle brackets keep us informed concerning order – $\ntuple{a, b}$ is a different pair from $\ntuple{b, a}$ even though they correspond to the same collection of two things, a and b. Suppose I now add the following stipulations:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[l] Lenin
		\item[m] Marx
		\item[h] Heidegger
		\item[s] Sartre
	\end{ekey}
Then `$Blm$' will be true, since \ntuple{Lenin, Marx} was in my explicit list. But `$Bml$' will be false, since \ntuple{Marx, Lenin} was not in my list. However, both `$Bhs$' and `$Bsh$' will be true, since both \ntuple{Heidegger, Sartre} and \ntuple{Sartre, Heidegger} are in my explicit list. 

It is perhaps worth being explicit that our sequences are ordered groups of things, not lists of words or names. (Unless our domain is the set of words or names!) The extension of a many-place predicate is no less a worldly collection than the extension of a name or a one-place predicate. The sequences that are members of that extension have things as their constituents, not names.

To make these ideas more precise, we would need to develop some \emph{set theory}, the mathematical theory of collections. This would give you some tools for modelling extensions and ordered pairs (and ordered triples, etc.), as well as some ideas about the metaphysical status of collections and sets. Indeed, set theoretic tools lie at the heart of contemporary linguistic approaches to meaning in natural languages. However, we have neither the time nor the need to cover set theory in this book. I shall leave these notions at an imprecise level; the general idea will be clear enough, I hope. 

\section{Zero-place Predicates} \label{s:zpp}

Consider these examples:  \begin{earg}
\item[\ex{zeropa}] Coober Pedy is a harsh place. It is remote.
\item[\ex{zeropb}] Coober Pedy is a harsh place. It is hot.
In \ref{zeropa}, `it' refers to Coober Pedy. Not so in \ref{zeropb}: `it' in that sentence is a \define{dummy pronoun}, one which needs to be present for syntactic reasons (every English sentence requires a grammatical subject), but which doesn't make any contribution to the meaning of the sentence. They are common with metereological reports: `it is raining', `it is dark', etc. 

\FOL does not have the syntactic feature of English that every sentence must include a singular term. The zero-place predicate `$R$' is a well-formed sentence of \FOL. We can use these zero-place predicates, the atomic sentences of \TFL\ that continue to be part of \FOL, to symbolise sentences like `It is raining'. Indeed, this seems obligatory: the normal symbolisation of a bare pronoun will make use of a free variable. An English sentence like `He is tall' doesn't manage to express a meaningful claim in the absence of some context providing a referent for `he'. So it might be symbolised `$Tx$' – a formula of \FOL\ that is not a sentence – to indicate that we are not expecting this sentence that is being symbolised to be true or false in a given intepretation. To symbolise `it is hot' as `$Hx$' would on these grounds be a mistake: `it is hot' expresses a proposition even without a referent assigned to the pronoun `it', and is true or false in a situation just depending on whether heat is present or not. So it could be adequately symbolised by a zero-place predicate `$H$', which is assigned a truth value in a given intepretation indicating whether it is hot or not. So the extension of a zero-place predicate is a truth value, not a member (or some members) of the domain. In that sense, the interpretations of \FOL\ extend the valuations of \TFL. (Of course, in \TFL\ we use atomic sentences to symbolise many complex subject-predicate sentences that it not be appropriate to symbolise by a zero-place predicate in \FOL.)


\section{Semantics for Identity}
Identity is a special predicate of \FOL. We write it a bit differently than other two-place predicates: `$x=y$' instead of `$Ixy$' (for example). More important, though, its meaning is fixed as to be genuine \emph{identity}, once and for all. Given a domain, the extension of `$=$' comprises just those pairs consisting of any member of the domain and itself. If the domain is numbers, for example, the extension of `$=$' on this domain will be $$\ntuple{1, 1}, \ntuple{2, 2}, \ntuple{3, 3},….$$ 

If two names \meta{a} and \meta{b} are assigned to the same object in a given symbolisation key, and thus have the same extension, $\meta{a}=\meta{b}$ will also be true  on that symbolisation key. And since the two names have the same extension, and \FOL\ is extensional, substituting one name for another will not change the truth value of any \FOL\ sentence. So, in particular, if `$a$' and `$b$' name the same object, then all of the following will be true:\label{model.nonidentity}
	\begin{align*}
	 	Aa &\eiff Ab \\
	 	Ba &\eiff Bb\\
		Raa &\eiff Rbb\\
		Raa & \eiff Rab\\
		Rca &\eiff Rcb\\
		\forall x Rxa &\eiff \forall x Rxb
	\end{align*}
This fact is sometimes called the \define{indiscernibility of identicals}, or Leibniz' Law (which we already encountered in §\ref{lli}): if two names denote the same thing, then no claim will be true when formulated using one of those names but false when formulated using the other in its place. That is because, at the level of extensions, there really is just one thing that those claims are about; how could that one thing be discernible from itself?

The converse claim – the \define{identity of indiscernibles} – is much more controversial. It is not defensible in \FOL. Suppose two objects differ in some feature $\symfrak{F}$, but our symbolisation key includes no predicate which denotes $\symfrak{F}$. Then we might not have any sentence true of the one object and false of the other, even though they are \emph{distinct} objects which have different properties. We can't tell them apart, not because they are really just one, but because we don't have the right words to talk about how they are different. \FOL\ thus allows that exactly the same predicates might be true of two distinct objects, and thus they are distinct but indiscernible when restricted to the resources of our symbolisation.

Once we move beyond \FOL\ and other extensional languages, even the indiscernibility of identicals is controversial. For example, consider cases of secret identities, like in Spider-Man. Suppose we consider the English predicate `MJ believes \gap{} shoots webs'. In the story, MJ believes that Spider-Man shoots webs, but she does not believe that Peter Parker shoots webs. Even though Spider-Man is Peter Parker, substituting one name for the other in this predicate turns a true sentence into a false one. An open sentence which doesn't always yield the truth value when we substitute names with the same referent is called \define{opaque}. The word which is responsible for the opacity here is the attitude verb `believes'. Intuitively, what matters for a belief ascription is not which things are identical, but which things the subject represents as identical. Other attitude verbs also lead to opacity: `knows', `wants', `remembers'. A language which contains opaque constructions cannot be completely represented in an extensional language like \FOL.  


\section{Interpretations} \label{ss.int}
I defined a \emph{valuation} in \TFL\ as any assignment of truth and falsity to atomic sentences. In \FOL, I am going to define an \define{interpretation} as consisting of three things:
	\begin{itemize}	
		\item the specification of a domain;
		\item for each name that we care to consider, an assignment of exactly one object within the domain as its extension;
		\item for each nonlogical $n$-place predicate $\meta{A}$ (i.e., any predicate other than `$=$') that we care to consider, a specification of its extension: what things (or pairs of things, or triples of thing, etc.) the predicate is to be true of – where all those things must be in the domain.
	\end{itemize}
A zero-place predicate (what we called `atomic sentences' in \TFL) has a truth value, either T or F, as its extension – thus the valuations of \TFL\ are intepretations of a very restricted part of \FOL\ – those interpretations which only care to consider zero-place predicates.

The symbolisation keys that I considered in chapter \ref{ch.FOL} consequently give us one very convenient way to present an interpretation. We shall continue to use them throughout this chapter. It is important to note, however, that the symbolisation key tends to associate each predicate with an already understood predicate (in English), and then uses that predicate as a classification rule to determine the extension of the predicate. We can, and sometimes do, offer an interpretation by simply giving the extensions of the intepreted \FOL\ expressions directly. We can simply list the items, pairs, triples, etc., in the extension assigned to a predicate. So the following two symbolisation keys give the same intepretation: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \begin{ekey}
	\item[\domain] Days of the week
	\item[B] \gap{1} is the day before \gap{2}
\end{ekey} 
\item \begin{ekey}
	\item[\domain] Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
	\item[B] $\ntuple{\text{Sunday}, \text{Monday}}$, $\ntuple{\text{Monday}, \text{Tuesday}}$, $\ntuple{\text{Tuesday}, \text{Wednesday}}$, $\ntuple{\text{Wednesday}, \text{Thursday}}$, $\ntuple{\text{Thursday}, \text{Friday}}$, $\ntuple{\text{Friday}, \text{Saturday}}$, $\ntuple{\text{Saturday}, \text{Sunday}}$.
\end{ekey}
\end{itemize}

So far, the domains we have used are drawn from the actual world, and English predicates have been used to assign their actual extensions to \FOL\ predicates. But a perfectly good interpretation might assign merely possible entities to the domain, and merely possible extensions to the predicates of \FOL, or a mixture of the two. 

Let's therefore make the assumption that interpretations are not restricted to actuality: \factoidbox{Any collection of objects, actual or merely possible, can serve as the domain of an interpretation. Any collection of objects drawn from that domain can serve as the extension of a one-place predicate, any collection of pairs of such objects can serve as the extension of a two-place predicate, etc.} A challenging question, which we will not address, is what enables us to talk about and apparently make use of such merely possible things in our interpretations.


\section{Predicates, Properties, and Relations}\label{predrel}

A feature that might be shared by a number of different things is called a \define{property}. These can be physical features like the property \emph{being red}, or the property \emph{having a mass of 2kg}; but we can also consider other properties that have a more social or mental basis, such as \emph{being a logician}, \emph{being rich}, or \emph{being annoying}. In many cases, a property will determine an extension, because we can think of the property as dividing the domain in two: into those things in the domain having a certain feature, and those lacking it. As the extension of a one-place predicate is some things, the things with a certain feature can correspond to an extension of a predicate. In that case we might say that the predicate represents the property. So on the domain of people, those people who have the property \emph{being a logician} is an extension, and we can offer an interpretation on which this extension is assigned to some one-place predicate.

We have to be careful about this though, for several reasons. The first is that a property is a way for something to be, independent of the domain in which it might be included. An extension by contrast is simply some things drawn from a given domain. So a property might determine an extension in a domain, but we should not take it to \emph{be} an extension. Likewise, we should not understand the symbolisation key as assigning a property as the \emph{meaning} of a predicate. Recalling §\ref{ss.int}, we might understand a symbolisation key as associate a \FOL\ predicate with a property as expressed by an English predicate. But this is just a means to assign an extension to the predicate, using the property as a classification of the domain. 

Another reason to hesitate in taking extensions to be properties is that, depending on the domain, many distinct properties will have the same extension. Consider the ratites, the bird family including ostriches, emus, cassowaries, and kiwis, among others. All living ratites are unable to fly. So on the domain of ratites, the property \emph{being a bird} determines the same extension as the property \emph{being flightless}. Suppose some predicate `$F$' is assigned this extension. If an extension is a property, then we'd have to say that extension is both \emph{is a bird} and \emph{is flightless} – but since those two are distinct, the extension cannot be both, and in fact it is clear that it cannot be either.\footnote{These properties are coextensive on this domain, but not in general. But some properties seem to be necessarily coextensive: take the properties \emph{being a plane figure with three sides} and \emph{being a plane figure with three vertices}. At first glance these are different properties – one involves counting lines, the other counting angles.}

A final reason for caution is that many legitimate extensions don't seem to correspond to genuine properties. It is hard to characterise the distinction between genuine properties and the others, but one idea is that genuine properties contribute to \emph{resemblance}. If two things are both red, then they resemble one another in appearance. But any things from a domain can form an extension, and we can imagine just selecting things, which can then be assigned to a predicate. In that case there is unlikely to be anything those things have in common just because they belong to an extension. Suppose I toss a coin ten times, and determine an extension by selecting $n$ from the domain of natural numbers if the $n$-th toss was heads. The extension I get is: $1, 3, 4, 5, 7$. But clearly nothing in this recipe means this extension corresponds to a genuine property. Nothing in \FOL\ requires that predicates must have genuine (i.e., resemblance-grounding) properties determining their extensions.  

Properties determine extensions for one-place predicates. The corresponding entity determining the extension of a many-place predicate is a \define{relation}. So the relation of \emph{loving} on a domain determines an extension, a set of pairs from the domain standing in that relation. The same caveats apply as in the case of properties: we shouldn't take \FOL\ predicates to have relations as their meaning, we shouldn't identify a relation with its extension, and we shouldn't take any extension to correspond to a genuine relation.

\section{Representing one-place predicates: Euler diagrams}\label{euler}

One way of presenting an interpretation that is often convenient is to present its extensions \emph{diagrammatically}.

The definition of an interpretation in §\ref{ss.int} entailed that a one-place predicate should have as its extension a collection of things drawn from the domain. If we help ourselves to the resources of set theory, the mathematical theory that treats collections and groups, then the extension of a predicate is a \define{subset} of the domain. The subsets of a given set $X$ are those sets such that everything in them is also in $X$. (So the set of children is a subset of the set of people – every member of the former is a member of the latter.) We can represent subsets graphically using a \define{Euler diagram}, without having to specify each of the items which is in the domain.

We begin by demarcating a region on the page to represent the domain – typically, a rectangle. Then for each one-place predicate, we can represent it by a sub-region of the domain, subject to the following rules: \begin{itemize}
\item The interior of a region associated with predicate $\meta{P}$ represents the members of the domain that are in the extension of $\meta{P}$; the exterior – the region within the domain but outside the given region – represents those members of the domain that are not in the extension of $\meta{P}$;
	\item If two predicates have extensions that overlap, the regions that represent them in the diagram should overlap.
	\item If one predicate has an extension that is entirely within the extension of another predicate, the region associated with the first should be entirely within the region associated with the second;
	\item If two predicates have nonoverlapping extensions, the regions that represent them should not overlap.
\end{itemize} We then label and shade each region to enable us to tell which predicates they are associated with. We may also add labelled dots to denote individuals who may fall into various predicate extensions.

These rules are quite abstract, but they are easy to apply in practice. Suppose we are given the following interpretation: \begin{ekey}
	\item[\domain] animal species
	\item[E] \gap{1} lays eggs;
	\item[M] \gap{1} is a mammal;
	\item[B] \gap{1} is a bird;
\end{ekey}
We may represent this interpretation as in Figure~\ref{fig:egglayers}. \begin{figure}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw[thick, rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle (5.5,4);
		\node (a) at (1,0.5) {Animals};
		\node (e) at (3,2) {Egg-layers};
		\node (b) at (3,1) {Birds};
		\node (m) at (1.5,3) {Mammals};
		\filldraw[fill=blue!30!white, draw =black, fill opacity=0.2] (3,1) ellipse (0.7cm and 0.6cm);
		\filldraw[fill=gray!30!white, draw =black, fill opacity=0.2] (3,2) ellipse (1.4cm and 1.8cm);
		\filldraw[fill=red!30!white, draw =black, fill opacity=0.2] (1.5,3) ellipse (1cm and 0.6cm);\end{tikzpicture} 
\caption{An interpretation represented diagrammatically.\label{fig:egglayers}}
\end{figure} In this diagram, the egg-layers are a subset of the animals – not all animals reproduce by laying eggs, so they do not coincide with the whole domain. The birds are a subset of animals too, and in fact wholly within the egg-layers: all birds reproduce oviparously. The mammals are a subset of the animals, and one that overlaps with the egg-layers (the monotremes!), though neither is contained in the other, so the regions overlap without either being wholly within the other. The birds and mammals do not have any common members, so the associated regions do not overlap at all. Note that the sizes of the regions may, but need not, represent the number of things within them. In this diagram they probably don't.

Another example. Consider this interpretation, discussed earlier on page \pageref{poison}: 
		\begin{ekey}
		\item[\domain] people and plants

		\item[S] \gap{1} sings a sad, sad song
		\item[R] \gap{1} is a rose
		\item[T] \gap{1} has a thorn
	\end{ekey}
The wisdom of Bret Michaels then tells us that the Euler diagram should look like the representation in Figure~\ref{fig:poison}. \begin{figure}[b]
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw[thick, rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle (7,4.2);
		\node (s) at (2,2) {sad song singers};
		\node (t) at (5,2) {thorn-havers};
		\node (c) at (2,1.1) {cowboys};
		\node (r) at (5,3) {roses};
		\filldraw[fill=blue!30!white, draw =black, fill opacity=0.2] (2,1.1) ellipse (0.8cm and 0.55cm);

		\filldraw[fill=red!30!white, draw =black, fill opacity=0.2] (5,3) ellipse (0.8cm and 0.65cm);
	\end{tikzpicture}\caption{A representation of `Every Rose Has Its Thorn'.\label{fig:poison}}
\end{figure}

We can start to see how interpretations can help us evaluate arguments quite vividly in this graphical environment. Recall this example from §\ref{s:FOLBuildingBlocks}: `Willard (`$w$') is a logician (`$L$'); Every logician wears a funny hat (`$F$') \ttherefore\ Willard wears a funny hat'.  This can be represented using an Euler diagram making use of a labelled dot to represent the individual Willard, as in Figure~\ref{fig:willard}. We can see from the diagram that this argument is valid: Willard falls in the region corresponding to `$F$' because he falls in the region corresponding to `$L$', which is wholly within the `$F$'-region. \begin{figure}
             \begin{tikzpicture}
              	\draw[thick, rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle (5.7,4);
		\node (a) at (1,0.5) {People};

		\node (b) at (4,2.5) {$F$};
		\node (w) at (2.5,2) {$w$};

             \end{tikzpicture}
          \caption{Representing the argument from §\ref{s:FOLBuildingBlocks}.\label{fig:willard}}    \end{figure} 

If you would like a real challenge, you might try to figure out the interpretation corresponding to the Euler diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:xkcd}.

\section{Representing two-place predicates: directed graphs} \label{graph}

Suppose we want to consider just a single two-place predicate, `$R$'. Then we can represent it, in some cases, by depicting the individual members of the domain by little dots (possibly with labels), and drawing a single-headed arrow from the first to the second of an ordered pair of items just in case that ordered pair falls within the extension of the predicate. Such a diagram is known as a \define{directed graph}. A directed graph comprises a collection of \define{nodes}, and a collection of arrows (ordered links) between those nodes; in our case, the nodes are the elements of the domain, and the arrows correspond to the extension of a two-place predicate on that domain, given the convention that when there is an arrow running from \meta{x} to \meta{y} in a graph, that means $\langle \meta{x}, \meta{y}\rangle$ is in the extension of the predicate.  

Let's consider some examples.

\begin{itemize}
	\item First, consider the following interpretation, written in the more standard manner:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[\domain] $1, 2, 3, 4$
		\item[R] \ntuple{1, 2}, \ntuple{2, 3}, \ntuple{3, 4}, \ntuple{4, 1}, \ntuple	{1, 3}.
	\end{ekey}
	That is, an interpretation whose domain is the first four positive whole 	numbers, and which interprets `$R$' as being true of and only of the specified 	pairs of numbers. This might be represented by the simple graph depicted in 	Figure~\ref{fig:graph1}.
	\begin{figure}[t]
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (atom1) at (0,2) {1};
	\node (atom2) at (2,2) {2};
	\node (atom3) at (2,0) {3};
	\node (atom4) at (0,0) {4};
	\draw[->, thick] (atom1)--(atom2);
	\draw[->, thick] (atom2)--(atom3);
	\draw[->, thick] (atom3)--(atom4);
	\draw[->, thick] (atom4)--(atom1);
	\draw[->, thick] (atom1) -- (atom3);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{A simple graph.\label{fig:graph1}}
	\end{figure}
\item 	Consider the following interpretation: \begin{ekey}
	\item[\domain] $1, 2, 3, 4$
	\item[R] \ntuple{1, 3}, \ntuple{3, 1}, \ntuple{3, 4}, \ntuple{1, 1}, \ntuple{3, 3}, \ntuple{4, 4}.
\end{ekey} We might offer the graph in Figure~\ref{fig:graph2} to represent it. The existence of pairs like \ntuple{1, 1} in the extension of $R$ is borne out in the presence of `loops' from nodes to themselves in the graph. (Because of these loops, our graph is not what graph theorists call a `simple' graph.) Notice that 2 is in the domain, and hence included as a node in the graph, but it has no arrows attached to it, because it is not included in the extension assigned to $R$. 
\begin{figure}[b]
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (atom1) at (0,2) {1};
\node (atom2) at (2,2) {2};
\node (atom3) at (2,0) {3};
\node (atom4) at (0,0) {4};
\draw[->, thick] (atom3)--(atom4);
\draw[->, thick] (atom1)+(-0.15,0.15) arc (-330:-30:.3); 
\draw[->, thick] (atom3)+(0.15,-0.15) arc (-150:150:.3); 
\draw[->, thick] (atom1) .. controls (0.75,0.75) .. (atom3);
\draw[->, thick] (atom3) .. controls (1.75,1.75) .. (atom1);
\draw[->, thick] (atom4)+(-0.15,0.15) arc (-330:-30:.3); 
\end{tikzpicture}\caption{A graph with `loops'  \label{fig:graph2}}
\end{figure} 

\item A third example is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:amia}, corresponding to this interpretation: \begin{ekey}
	\item[\text{Domain}] Amia, Barbara, Corine, Davis
	\item[F] \ntuple{Amia, Amia}, \ntuple{Barbara, Barbara}, \ntuple{Davis, Davis}, \ntuple{Amia, Barbara}, \ntuple{Amia, Corine}, \ntuple{Barbara, Amia}, \ntuple{Barbara, Corine}, \ntuple{Corine, Barbara}
\end{ekey}
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (atom1) at (0,2) {Amia};
\node (atom2) at (2,2) {Barbara};
\node (atom3) at (2,0) {Corine};
\node (atom4) at (0,0) {Davis};
\draw[->, thick] (atom1) to[out=280,in=180] (atom3);
\draw[->, thick] (atom1) to[out=30,in=150] (atom2);
\draw[->, thick] (atom1)+(-0.15,0.2) arc (-330:-30:.5);
\draw[->, thick] (atom2) to[out=210,in=330] (atom1);
\draw[->, thick] (atom2)+(+0.3,0.2) arc (150:-150:.5);
\draw[->, thick] (atom2) to[out=250,in=110](atom3);
\draw[->, thick] (atom3)to[out=70,in=290](atom2);
\draw[->, thick] (atom4)+(-0.15,0.2) arc (30:330:.5);
\end{tikzpicture}\caption{\label{fig:amia} A more complicated graph.}
 \end{figure}
\end{itemize}

If we wanted, we can extend our graphical conventions, making our diagrams more complex in order to depict more complex interpretations. For example, we could introduce another kind of arrow (maybe with a dashed shaft) to represent a further two-place predicate.\footnote{This kind of `directed multigraph' is sometimes called a \define{quiver}.} We could add names as labels attached to particular objects. To symbolise the extension of a one-place predicate, we might simply adopt the approach from §\ref{euler}, and mark a shaded region around some particular objects and stipulate that the thus encircled objects (and only them) are to fall in the extension of some predicate `$H$', say.\footnote{We needn't stop there. For example, we could introduce \define{directed hypergraphs}, where the edges can join more than two nodes.} 

All of these graphical innovations are used in Figure~\ref{fig:complex}, which  graphically represents the following interpretation: \begin{ekey}
	\item[\domain] $2,3,4,5,6$
	\item[G] $\gap{1} \geqslant 4$. 
	\item[D] \gap{1} is distinct from and exactly divisible by \gap{2};
	\item[T] $\gap{1} + 3 = \gap{2}$;
	\item[f] $4$;
\end{ekey} 
Here the label `$f$' represents the name attached to 4, the blue dotted arrow represents the relation assigned to $T$, the black solid arrow represents the relation assigned to $D$, and the grey ellipse represents the collection of things in the domain which fall in the extension assigned to $G$. 
\begin{figure}[b]

\node (atom3) at (3,2) {3};
\coordinate[label=below right:`$f$'] (atom4) at (0,0);

\section{Properties of Binary Relations} \label{binary}

The extension of a two-place predicate is a collection of ordered pairs drawn from a domain $D$. Such a collection is also known as a \define{binary relation} on $D$. Binary relations have many interesting features. We have seen some of them already in §\ref{lli}, when we noted that reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity are all features of identity. We will now treat these notions more generally. Binary relations provide some good examples of how directed graphs can help grasp an interpretation, because the properties of binary relations often correspond to easily grasped conditions on the associated graphs.

\begin{itemize}
 	\item \emph{This section should be regarded as optional, and only for the dedicated student of logic.}
 \end{itemize} 

\factoidbox{\begin{itemize}
	\item A binary relation $\symfrak{R}$  on $D$ is \define{reflexive} iff for any $x$ in $D$, $\ntuple{x,x}$ is in $\symfrak{R}$. 
	\item $\symfrak{R}$ is \define{irreflexive} on $D$ iff for no $x$ in $D$ is $\ntuple{x, x}$ in $\symfrak{R}$.
	\item If $\symfrak{R}$ is neither reflexive nor irreflexive, it is nonreflexive.
\end{itemize}}
An example of a reflexive relation is the extension of `\gap{1} is the same height as \gap{2}' on the domain of people. Everyone is the same height as themselves. An example of an irreflexive relation is the extension of `\gap{1} is taller than \gap{2}' on the domain of people, since no one is taller than they are. An example of a nonreflexive relation might be the extension of `\gap{1} trusts the judgment of \gap{2}' on the domain of people: some people trust their own judgment, while others second-guess themselves. Pictorially, a reflexive relation corresponds to a graph in which every node in the graph has an arrow pointing to itself, such as in Figure~\ref{fig:reflex}. 
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (atom1) at (0,2) {1};
\node (atom3) at (2,0) {3};
\node (atom4) at (0,0) {4};
\draw[->, thick] (atom3)--(atom4);
\draw[->, thick] (atom1)+(-0.15,0.15) arc (-330:-30:.3); 
\draw[->, thick] (atom3)+(0.15,-0.15) arc (-150:150:.3); 
\draw[->, thick] (atom1) .. controls (0.75,0.75) .. (atom3);
\draw[->, thick] (atom3) .. controls (1.75,1.75) .. (atom1);
\draw[->, thick] (atom4)+(-0.15,0.15) arc (-330:-30:.3); 
\end{tikzpicture}\caption{A graph of a reflexive relation on $\{1, 3, 4\}$.\label{fig:reflex}}
\end{figure} Note the resemblance between this graph and the graph in Figure~\ref{fig:graph2}. They are almost the same, except the earlier Figure shows a relation in which the domain contains the number $2$, which is \emph{not} paired with itself in the relation. A relation being reflexive requires everything in the domain relate to itself: in Figure~\ref{fig:graph2}, that condition is not satisfied.  The graph of an irreflexive relation has no loops from a node directly to itself, such as the relation depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:graph1}. The graph of a nonreflexive relation will have a mixture of nodes with and without loops, such as in Figure~\ref{fig:graph2}.

Reflexivity is a property of an extension, not a predicate (except the identity predicate). But there is a sentence of \FOL\ which expresses reflexivity. Suppose the two-place predicate `$R$' is assigned a relation $\symfrak{R}$, a set of pairs, as its extension on $D$: then `$\forall x Rxx$' (`everything bears $R$ to itself') will be true under this interpretation iff $\symfrak{R}$ is reflexive. 

\factoidbox{\begin{itemize}
	\item A binary relation $\symfrak{R}$ is \define{transitive} iff for any $x$, $y$, and $z$, whenever $\ntuple{x, y}$ and $\ntuple{y, z}$ are in $\symfrak{R}$, then $\ntuple{x, z}$ is also in $\symfrak{R}$.
	\item $\symfrak{R}$ is \define{intransitive} iff for any $x$, $y$, and $z$, whenever $\ntuple{x, y}$ and $\ntuple{y, z}$ are in $\symfrak{R}$, then $\ntuple{x, z}$ is \emph{not} in $\symfrak{R}$.
	\item $\symfrak{R}$ is nontransititive iff it is neither transitive nor intransitive.
\end{itemize} If the predicate `$R$' is assigned $\symfrak{R}$ as its extension in some interpretation, then $\symfrak{R}$ is transitive iff `$\forall x \forall y \forall z ((Rxy \eand Ryz) \eif Rxz)$' holds in this interpretation.}
An example of a transitive relation is the extension of `\gap{1} is older than \gap{2}' on the domain of buildings. Whenever one building is older than another, which is older than a third, the first must be older than the third. An example of an intransitive relation is the extension of `\gap{1} is the successor of \gap{2}' on the domain of numbers, where $x$ is the successor of $y$ iff $x = y+1$. While $7$ is the successor of $6$, and $6$ is the successor of $5$, it is not the case that $7$ is the sucessor of $5$. An example of a nontransitive relation is the extension of `there is a direct flight between \gap{1} and \gap{2}' on the domain of the Qantas network. There is a direct flight from Adelaide to Perth, and a direct flight from Perth to Broome, but no direct flight from Adelaide to Broome. On the other hand, there is a direct flight from Perth to Sydney, and there is a direct flight from Adelaide to Sydney. 

Pictorially, a reflexive relation is one where there is a `shortcut' between any two nodes that can be reached from one another by travelling along arrows in the intended direction. Consider the graph in Figure~\ref{fig:trans}. 
\begin{figure}[t]
	\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (bh) at (6,0) {Bonython (1936)};
\node (nb) at (9,0) {Napier (1958)};
\node (eh) at (3,0) {Elder (1900)};
\node (mb) at (0,0) {Mitchell (1882)};
\draw[->, thick] (mb)--(eh);
\draw[->, thick] (mb) .. controls (3,0.75) .. (bh);
\draw[->, thick] (mb) .. controls (5,2) .. (nb);
\draw[->, thick] (eh)--(bh);
\draw[->, thick] (eh) .. controls (7,-1) .. (nb);
\draw[->, thick] (bh)--(nb); 
\end{tikzpicture}\caption{A graph of the transitive relation `older than' on some University of Adelaide buildings.\label{fig:trans}}
\end{figure} Intuitively, one can `get from' the oldest (the Mitchell Building) to the youngest (the Napier Building) via the intermediate aged Elder Hall and Bonython Hall. But you can also go directly, following the topmost curve. The graph of an intransitive relation has no shortcuts of this sort. The graph of a nontransitive relation has a mix of shortcuts, such as the graph of our Qantas example depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:qantas}. 
\begin{figure}[b]
	\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (b) at (1,2.5) {Broome};
\node (s) at (5.5,0) {Sydney};
\node (a) at (4,-1) {Adelaide};
\node (p) at (0,0) {Perth};
\draw[->, thick] (p) .. controls (0,2) .. (b);
\draw[->, thick] (p)--(a);
\draw[->, thick] (p)--(s);
\draw[->, thick] (a) .. controls (2,-1.25) .. (p);
\draw[->, thick] (a) .. controls (5,-1) .. (s);
\draw[->, thick] (s)--(a);
\draw[->, thick] (s) .. controls (3,0.75) .. (p);
\draw[->, thick] (s)--(b);
\draw[->, thick] (b) .. controls (3.5,2) ..  (s);
\draw[->, thick] (b) .. controls (1,1) ..  (p);
\end{tikzpicture}\caption{An extract of Qantas' route network.\label{fig:qantas}}
\end{figure}

One interesting question: is the relation depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:graph2} intransitive? There are no obvious shortcuts; while you can get from 1 to 3, and from 3 to 4, you cannot go directly from 1 to 4. But those loops actually make for some degenerate shortcuts. E.g., there is an edge from 1 ($x$) to 3 ($y$), and from 3 ($y$) to 3 ($z$), and there is the `shortcut' from 1 ($x$) to 3 ($z$). This may not be how you were thinking of transitivity, but look back at the definition, which is phrased in terms of picking \emph{any} pairs from the domain. This even includes those pairs consisting of a node and itself.

\factoidbox{\begin{itemize}
	\item A binary relation $\symfrak{R}$ is \define{symmetric} iff for any $\ntuple{x, y}$ in $\symfrak{R}$, $\ntuple{y, x}$ is also in $\symfrak{R}$.
	\item $\symfrak{R}$ is \define{asymmetric} iff for any $\ntuple{x, y}$ in $\symfrak{R}$, $\ntuple{y, x}$ is \emph{not} in $\symfrak{R}$.
	\item $\symfrak{R}$ is \define{antisymmetric} iff for any $\ntuple{x, y}$ in $\symfrak{R}$, $\ntuple{y, x}$ is in $\symfrak{R}$ \emph{only if} $x=y$.
	\item $\symfrak{R}$ is \define{nonsymmetric} iff it is neither symmetric, asymmetric, nor antisymmetric.
\end{itemize}If the predicate `$R$' is assigned $\symfrak{R}$ as its extension in some interpretation, then $\symfrak{R}$ is symmetric iff `$\forall x \forall y (Rxy \eif Ryx)$' holds in this interpretation.} An example of a symmetric relation is the extension of `\gap{1} lives next door to to \gap{2}' on the domain of people. If Alf lives next to Beth, then Beth also lives next door to Alf. An asymmetric relation is `\gap{1} is greater than \gap{2}' on the natural numbers: if $x>y$, then it cannot also be that $y > x$. If we consider not `greater than', but the weaker relation `greater than or equal to', we see an example of an antisymmetric relation: if $x≥y$ then it can be the case that $y≥x$ only in the special case where $x=y$. An example of a nonsymmetric relation might be the relation `\gap{1} loves \gap{2}' on the domain of people: sometimes love is requited, so that both members of a given pair love each other; and sometimes it is unrequited.

Pictorially, whenever we have an arrow from one node to another, if there is also a `reverse' arrow back from the second to the first, then the relation depicted is symmetric. See the depiction of the `next to' relation in Figure~\ref{fig:nextto}. 
\begin{figure}[b]
	\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (a) at (0,0) {Alf};
\node (b) at (2,0) {Beth};
\node (c) at (4,0) {Carl};

\draw[->, thick] (b) .. controls (3,1) .. (c);

\draw[->, thick] (c) .. controls (3,-1) .. (b);
\end{tikzpicture}\caption{`next to': a symmetric but intransitive relation.\label{fig:nextto}}
\end{figure} A relation is asymmetric if there are never such reverse arrows. A relation is antisymmetric if the only time there are arrows from $x$ to $y$ and back is when $x=y$ and there is a loop. I depict both relations $>$ and $≥$ in Figure~\ref{fig:gg}; the difference is that that the antisymmetric relation $≥$ has an arrow from each node to itself.
\begin{figure}[t]

\end{figure}

The observant reader will have noticed that, among these definitions of properties of binary relations, the only definition which actually mentions the domain is the definition of reflexivity. All the other definitions are \emph{conditional} in form: they say, if certain pairs are in the extension, then certain other pairs will (or won't) be too. We needn’t specify a domain to check whether these conditionals hold of any relation. But to check whether a relation is reflexive, we need not only the ordered pairs of the relation, but also what the domain is, so we can see if any members of the domain are missing from the relation.\footnote{Reflexivity is an \emph{extrinsic} property of a relation – you can't tell just from the extension whether a relation is reflexive, because it is relative to the domain from which the relata of the relation may be drawn. The others are \emph{intrinsic} properties of a relation; whether the relation has them is determined just by which pairs are in the relation. The very same set of pairs might be reflexive on one domain and nonreflexive on another, but it will be symmetric on every domain if it is symmetric on any.}

These properties of binary relations are not completely independent of each other. For example, a reflexive relation cannot be asymmetric: a relation $\symfrak{R}$ is asymmetric only if it is never the case that for any $x$ and $y$, $\ntuple{x,y}$ is in $\symfrak{R}$; but if the relation is reflexive, then every pair consisting of something and itself is in $\symfrak{R}$, and nothing prohibits us from picking the same value for $x$ and $y$. A reflexive relation can at best be antisymmetric. 


A relation which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive is known as an \define{equivalence relation}. We've already established that identity is an equivalence relation in §\ref{lli}. But there are other equivalence relations too: consider `\gap{1} is the same height as \gap{2}'. This relation will structure the domain into clusters of people with the same height as each other. Such a division into groups is known as a \define{partition}, and the individual groups are known as cells. When you partition a domain, you sort the domain into cells which are uniform with respect a given feature – in this case, height. There will be no connections between cells of the partition, but within each cell, each person will be related to every other person in the cell. These cells are also known as \define{equivalence classes}. Identity is the extreme case of an equivalence relation, because it partitions the domain into cells containing entities that are equivalent in every respect, i.e., are identical, and hence each cell contains just one individual member.

A relation on a domain $D$ is \define{total} iff for any $x$ and $y$ in $D$, either $\ntuple{x,y}$ or $\ntuple{y,x}$ (or both) is in the extension.\footnote{If the predicate `$R$' is assigned $\symfrak{R}$ as its extension in some interpretation, then $\symfrak{R}$ is total iff `$\forall x \forall y (Rxy \eor Ryx)$' holds in this interpretation.} Any two things are related, in some way, by a total relation.  We can use the notion of totality to define a kind of relation that is of particular mathematical importance: \factoidbox{A relation $\symfrak{R}$ on a domain $D$ is an \define{ordering} iff $\symfrak{R}$ is reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric. Special cases: \begin{itemize}
	\item $\symfrak{R}$ is a \define{strict order}  iff $\symfrak{R}$ is an asymmetric order; i.e., iff $\symfrak{R}$ is reflexive, transitive, and asymmetric.
	\item $\symfrak{R}$ is a \define{total order}  iff $\symfrak{R}$ is total and is an order;
	\item $\symfrak{R}$ is a \define{strict total order}  iff $\symfrak{R}$ is total and is a strict order.
\end{itemize}An order that is not total is commonly called a \define{partial order}.}
An order, as the name suggests, gives a particular kind of structure to a domain. A strict total order arranges everything in the domain in an order without any ties; an example would be the greater than relation $>$ we considered above. A non-mathematical example might be `\gap{1} is taller than \gap{2}', which arranges the domain of people in a linear way from tallest to shortest. If there are ties permitted, then the relation is  not strict: a total order with ties is $≥$ on the natural numbers, or the relation `\gap{1} is no shorter than \gap{2}', which allows that whatever fills the first slot might be either taller than, or the same height as, whatever fills the second. 

If not everything in the domain is comparable, or ordered with respect to each other, the relation is partial. Consider a railway network, in which all lines radiate from a central station, like the Adelaide Metro network.  The relation `\gap{1} is no further along the line than \gap{2}' is a partial order.\footnote{Every station is no further along than itself; pick any two distinct stations, such as Woodville and Kilkenny: if Kilkenny is no further along than Woodville, then Woodville is further along than Kilkenny; and if we pick three stations, such as Oaklands, Brighton and Seacliff, then since Oaklands is no further than Brighton, and Bright is no further than Seacliff, it follows that Oaklands is no further than Seacliff.} But there are many pairs of incomparable stations: Woodville is not on the same line as Oaklands, so neither is further along the line than the other. (We could create a total order, perhaps by measuring distance or counting stations along the line, and say that two stations are equally far away iff they are the same number of stops from Adelaide. But we are focussed here on the partial order induced by the actual railway network.) A strict partial order would be `\gap{1} is further along the line than \gap{2}', which excludes ties. 

A mathematical example of a partial order is the subset relation $\subseteq$. Consider some set $X$ containing just $a$ and $b$ as members. Recall from §\ref{euler} that the subsets of $X$ are those sets such that everything in them is also in $X$. So $X$ is a subset of $X$, as is the set just containing $a$, and the set just containing $b$. Finally, the empty set (with no members) obviously is a subset of any set (trivially – nothing in it is absent from any other set). That gives the structure of subsets depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:sbst}. The corresponding strict partial order $\subset$ results from removing any loops from a set to itself in that diagram.
 \begin{figure}
 \begin{tikzpicture}
 \node (ab) at (3,3) {$\{a,b\}$};
\node (b) at (0,1.5) {$\{b\}$};

 \end{tikzpicture}\caption{Black arrows indicate both $\subset$ and $\subseteq$, dotted arrows indicate $\subseteq$ only, on the domain $\wp\{a,b\}=\{\{a,b\},\{a\},\{b\},\emptyset\}$.\label{fig:sbst}}
 \end{figure} This is obviously a partial order, since $\{a\}$ is neither a subset of $\{b\}$ or vice versa, though is is a subset of the original set $\{a,b\}$, and the empty set $\emptyset$ is a subset of both.

Since \FOL\ is an extensional language, if let the \FOL\ name `$s$' denote Superman, and the name `$c$' denote Clark Kent, then `$s=c$' will be true. But it will be true for the same reason that `$s=s$' is true: because \ntuple{Clark Kent, Clark Kent} is in the extension of `$=$'. Can you use this observation as the basis for any argument that English is not an extensional language?

\chapter{Truth in \textnormal{\FOL}}\label{s:TruthFOL}
We now know what interpretations are. Since, among other things, they tell us which predicates are true of which objects – and pairs, etc., of objects –, they provide us with an account of the truth of atomic sentences. But we must show how to extend that to an account of what it is for any \FOL\ sentence to be true or false in an interpretation. 

We know from §\ref{s:FOLSentences} that there are three kinds of sentence in \FOL: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item atomic sentences (i.e., atoms of \FOL\ which have no free variables);
		\item sentences whose main connective is a sentential connective; and
		\item sentences whose main connective is a quantifier.
	\end{itemize}
We need to explain truth for all three kinds of sentence.

I shall offer a completely general explanation in this section. However, to try to keep the explanation comprehensible, I shall at several points use the following interpretation:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[\domain] all people born before 2000\textsc{ce}
		\item[a] Aristotle
		\item[b] George W Bush
		\item[W] \gap{1} is wise
		\item[R] \gap{1} was born before \gap{2}
	\end{ekey}
This will be my \emph{go-to example} in what follows. 

\section{Atomic Sentences}\label{fol.truth.atom}
The truth of atomic sentences should be fairly straightforward. The sentence `$Wa$' should be true just in case `$W$' is true of whatever is named by `$a$'. Given our go-to interpretation, this is true iff `is wise' is true of whatever is named by `Aristotle', i.e., iff Aristotle is wise. In fact (in the actual world) Aristotle is wise. So the sentence is true. Equally, `$Wb$' is false on our go-to interpretation, because George W Bush is not wise.

Likewise, on this interpretation, `$Rab$' is true iff the object named by `$a$' was born before the object named by `$b$'. Well, Aristotle was born before Bush. So `$Rab$' is true. Equally, `$Raa$' is false: Aristotle was not born before Aristotle. We can summarise these intuitive ideas more generally:
\factoidbox{\begin{itemize}
\item When $\meta{F}$ is a one-place predicate, and $\meta{a}$ is a name, then $\meta{F}\meta{a}$ is true in an interpretation iff:\\ the object assigned as the extension of $\meta{a}$ is among the objects assigned to the extension of $\meta{F}$.
\item When $\meta{R}$ is an $n$-place predicate and $\meta{a}_{1}, \meta{a}_{2}, …, \meta{a}_{n}$ are names (not necessarily all different from each other), $\meta{R}\meta{a}_{1}\meta{a}_{2}…\meta{a}_{n}$ is true in an interpretation iff:\\
the $n$-tuple of objects assigned as the extensions of $\meta{a}_{1}, \meta{a}_{2}, …, \meta{a}_{n}$ in that interpretation, \ntuple{$\meta{a}_{1}, …, \meta{a}_{n}$}, is among the $n$-tuples comprising the extension assigned to $\meta{R}$ in that interpretation.
\end{itemize}} 

Two other kinds of atomic sentences exist: zero-place predicates, and identity sentences.
\begin{itemize}
	\item A zero-place predicate is true in an interpretation iff it is assigned the extension true in that interpretation.

	Here in fact, we are using \TFL\ valuations as constituents of \FOL\ interpretations. (A valuation is what you get when you are only intepreting zero-place predicates; we will want it to turn out that the part of \FOL\ which deals just with zero-place predicates and their truth-functional combinations is the familiar language \TFL, so those interpretations will have to behave like the valuations we are familiar with.)
		\item Identity sentences (two names flanking the identity predicate) are also easy to handle. Where \meta{a} and \meta{b} are any names, $\meta{a} = \meta{b}$ is true in an interpretation  iff:
		 \meta{a} and \meta{b} have the same extension (are assigned the very same object) in that interpretation.\footnote{Of course this is just the result of applying the conditions above for atomic sentences with two-place predicates to the special constant extension assigned to `$=$': $\meta{a}=\meta{b}$ is true iff the pair of the extensions of \meta{a} and \meta{b} is in the extension of identity, which can only happen if the extensions are the same.}

So in our go-to interpretation, `$a = b$' is false, since Aristotle is distinct from Bush; but `$a=a$' is true.
\end{itemize}


\section{Sentential Connectives}\label{fol.truth.sent}

 In \TFL, the truth value of a sentence in a valuation depends only on its main connective, and the truth values of its constituent sentences (§\ref{s:SchematicTruthTables}). The truth value of a complex sentence ‘percolates up’ from those of its grammatically simpler constituents.

Things are exactly the same when it comes to \FOL\ sentences that are built up from simpler ones using the truth-functional connectives that were familiar from \TFL. (We introduced such sentences in §\ref{s:FOLSentences}.) The rules governing these truth-functional connectives are \emph{exactly} the same as they were when we considered \TFL. Here they are:
	\factoidbox{Where \meta{A} and \meta{B} are any sentences of \FOL, \begin{itemize}
		\item 
		$\meta{A} \eand \meta{B}$ is true in an interpretation  iff:\\ both $\meta{A}$ is true and $\meta{B}$ is true in that interpretation
		\item 	$\meta{A} \eor \meta{B}$ is true in an interpretation  iff:\\ either $\meta{A}$ is true or $\meta{B}$ is true in that interpretation
\item 	$\enot \meta{A}$ is true in an interpretation  iff: \\$\meta{A}$ is false in that interpretation
\item $\meta{A} \eif \meta{B}$ is true in an interpretation  iff:\\ either $\meta{A}$ is false or $\meta{B}$ is true in that interpretation
\item $\meta{A} \eiff \meta{B}$ is true in an interpretation  iff: \\$\meta{A}$ has the same truth value as $\meta{B}$ in that interpretation
	\end{itemize}}
This presents the very same information as the schematic truth tables for the connectives; it just does it in a slightly different way. Some examples will probably help to illustrate the idea. On our go-to interpretation:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item `$(a = a \eand Wa)$' is true;
		\item `$(Rab \eand Wb)$' is false because, although `$Rab$' is true, `$Wb$' is false;
		\item `$(a = b \eor Wa)$' is true;
		\item `$\enot a = b$' is true;
		\item `$(Wa \eand \enot( a= b \eand Rab))$' is true, because `$Wa$' is true and `$a = b$' is false.
	\end{itemize}
Make sure you understand these examples.

\section{When the Main Connective is a Quantifier}

The exciting innovation in \FOL, though, is the use of \emph{quantifiers}. And in fact, expressing the truth conditions for quantified sentences is a bit more fiddly than one might expect. The general principle of compositionality faces a challenge when it comes to sentences whose main connective is a quantifier. We cannot say that the truth value of `$\exists x Fx$' depends on its syntax and the truth value of `$Fx$', because we have no guidance in assigning a truth value to a formula with a free variable (though see §\ref{s:Sats}).

Here is a first naïve thought. We want to say that `$\forall x \meta{F}x$' is true iff \meta{F} is true of everything in the domain. This should not be too problematic: our interpretation will specify directly what \meta{F} is true of. 

Unfortunately, this naïve first thought is not general enough. For example, we want to be able to say that `$\forall x \exists y \meta{L}xy$' is true just in case `$\exists y \meta{L}xy$' is true of everything in the domain. And this is problematic, since our interpretation does not directly specify what `$\exists y \meta{L}xy$' is to be true of. Instead, whether or not this is true of something should follow just from the interpretation of $\meta{L}$, the domain, and the meanings of the quantifiers. 

So here is a second naïve thought. We might try to say that `$\forall x \exists y \meta{L}xy$' is to be true in an interpretation iff $\exists y \meta{L}\meta{a}y$ is true for \emph{every} name \meta{a} that we have included in our interpretation. And similarly, we might try to say that $\exists y \meta{L}\meta{a}y$ is true just in case $\meta{L}\meta{a}\meta{b}$ is true for \emph{some} name \meta{b} that we have included in our interpretation. (This kind of approach is known as \define{substitutional quantification} – our own approach below in §\ref{fol.truth.quant} will make use of substitution, but in a more sophisticated way.)

Unfortunately, this is not right either. To see this, observe that in our go-to interpretation, we have only given interpretations for \emph{two} names, `$a$' and `$b$'. But the domain – all people born before the year 2000\textsc{ce} – contains many more than two people. I have no intention of trying to name \emph{all} of them!  In most interpretations, things in the domain go unnamed; we can't understand quantifiers as ranging over only actually named things without missing out some things in such interpretations.\footnote{Can we solve this issue by the brute force proposal to simply assign everything in the domain a name? That is not possible, because there are not enough names. Remember (§\ref{s:FOLSentences}) that names in \FOL\ consist of the English letters $a,…,r$ with numerical subscripts if needed. So every name in \FOL\ consists of a letter and a finite numeral. It turns out you can arrange all these names in a single, infinitely long list (basically, represent each name by a code number, and order the names by the size of the code number). The items in a list like that can be enumerated. But Cantor famously showed that some things are too many to be enumerated; any single list which attempts to include all of them would inevitably miss some. (One example: while you can enumerate all the finite sequences of itemse from a finite alphabet, you cannot enumerate all the infinite sequences of such items.) So some collections are too many for them all to have names, because we'd run out of names before labelling them all. So substitutional quantification can't handle all examples of quantification.

Cantor's result, and the `diagonal argument' he used to establish it, is discussed in ch.~5 of Tim Button (2021) \emph{Set Theory: An Open Introduction}, \httpurl{st.openlogicproject.org/settheory-screen.pdf}.}


So here is a third thought. (And this thought is not naïve, but correct.) Although it is not the case that we have named \emph{everyone}, each person \emph{could} have been given a name. So we should focus on this possibility of extending an interpretation, by adding a previously uninterpreted name to our interpretation. I shall offer a few examples of how this might work, centring on our go-to interpretation, and I shall then present the formal definition. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item In our go-to interpretation, `$\exists x Rbx$' should be true. After all, in the domain, there is certainly someone who was born after Bush. Lady Gaga is one of those people. Indeed, if we were to extend our go-to interpretation – temporarily, mind – by adding the name `$c$' to refer to Lady Gaga, then `$Rbc$' would be true on this extended interpretation. And this, surely, should suffice to make `$\exists x Rbx$' true on the original go-to interpretation. 
	\item In our go-to interpretation, `$\exists x (Wx \eand Rxa)$' should also be true. After all, in the domain, there is certainly someone who was both wise and born before Aristotle. Socrates is one such person. Indeed, if we were to extend our go-to interpretation by letting a previously uninterpreted name, `$c$', denote Socrates, then `$Wc \eand Rca$' would be true on this extended interpretation. Again, this should surely suffice to make `$\exists x (Wx \eand Rxa)$' true on the original go-to interpretation. 
	\item In our go-to interpretation, `$\forall x \exists y Rxy$' should be false. After all, consider the last person born in the year 1999. I don't know who that was, but if we were to extend our go-to interpretation by letting a previously uninterpreted name, `$d$', denote that person, then we would not be able to find anyone else in the domain to denote with some further previously uninterpreted name, perhaps `$e$', in such a way that `$Rde$' would be true. Indeed, no matter \emph{whom} we named with `$e$', `$Rde$' would be false. And this observation is surely sufficient to make `$\exists y Rdy$' \emph{false} in our extended interpretation. And this is sufficient to make `$\forall x \exists y Rxy$' false on the original interpretation.
\end{itemize} Look at the multiplying extensions; the quantifiers involved are mirrored in the interpretations we are asked to consider. `$\exists x Fx$' is true if there \emph{exists} an extended interpretation where some named thing is $F$, while `$\forall x Fx$' is true if \emph{every} extended interpretation makes the newly named thing $F$. In effect, we handle quantification over possibly unnamed objects in a domain by quantifying over potential interpretations that assign names to those objects while keeping everything else the same.  

Some readers might prefer a more visual aid. If the domain is large, we need to consider \emph{lots} of extended intepretations, because we need to consider assigning each of the items in the domain a new name. So I will consider a very simple interpretation J, with two objects and some binary relation between them, pictured here: 
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle (3,2);
\node (a) at (0.75,1) {•};
\node (b) at (2,1.1) {•};
\draw[->, thick] (a)--(b);
\draw[->, thick] (b)+(+0.1,0.2) arc (140:-140:.2);
\node (r) at (2.75,0.25) {J};
 \end{tikzpicture} 
\end{center}
Note there are no labels on these nodes. No names are assigned to objects in this interpretation. The arrows give the extension of `$Q$' in this interpretation J. Suppose we want to consider whether `$\exists x \forall y Qyx$' is true in J. Then we want to know whether there is some way of assigning a new name `$d$' to entities in this domain to make `$\forall y Qyd$' come out true. So there are two interpretations to consider, L and R, because there are two things in the domain to which `$d$' might be attached: 
\begin{center}
	 \begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle (3,2);
\node (a) at (0.75,1) {•};
\node (b) at (2,1.1) {•};
\node [orange] (d) at (0.85,1.3) {`$d$'};
\node (l) at (2.75,0.25) {L};
\draw[->, thick] (a)--(b);
\draw[->, thick] (b)+(+0.1,0.2) arc (140:-140:.2);
 \end{tikzpicture} \qquad \begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle (3,2);
\node (a) at (0.75,1) {•};
\node (b) at (2,1.1) {•};
\node [orange] (d) at (1.9,1.4) {`$d$'};
\node (r) at (2.75,0.25) {R};
\draw[->, thick] (a)--(b);
\draw[->, thick] (b)+(+0.1,0.2) arc (140:-140:.2);
 \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center} 
The original sentence is true in J iff `$\forall y Qyd$' is true in one of these extended interpretations. But in turn that is the case iff `$Qfd$' is true in each interpretation extending the already extended interpretation by adding yet another new name `$f$'. So now there are four interpretations to consider: two extensions of L, and two extensions of R:
\begin{center}
	 \begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle (3,2);
\node (a) at (0.75,1) {•};
\node (b) at (2,1.1) {•};
\node (d) at (0.85,1.3) {`$d$'};
\node [orange] (e) at (0.75,0.75) {`$f$'};
\node (l) at (2.65,0.25) {LL};
\draw[->, thick] (a)--(b);
\draw[->, thick] (b)+(+0.1,0.2) arc (140:-140:.2);
 \end{tikzpicture}~\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle (3,2);
\node (a) at (0.75,1) {•};
\node (b) at (2,1.1) {•};
\node (d) at (0.85,1.3) {`$d$'};
\node [orange] (e) at (1.9,0.75) {`$f$'};
\node (l) at (2.65,0.25) {LR};
\draw[->, thick] (a)--(b);
\draw[->, thick] (b)+(+0.1,0.2) arc (140:-140:.2);
 \end{tikzpicture}~\quad~\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle (3,2);
\node (a) at (0.75,1) {•};
\node (b) at (2,1.1) {•};
\node (d) at (1.9,1.4) {`$d$'};
\node [orange] (e) at (0.75,0.75) {`$f$'};
\node (r) at (2.65,0.25) {RL};
\draw[->, thick] (a)--(b);
\draw[->, thick] (b)+(+0.1,0.2) arc (140:-140:.2);
 \end{tikzpicture}~\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle (3,2);
\node (a) at (0.75,1) {•};
\node (b) at (2,1.1) {•};
\node (d) at (1.9,1.4) {`$d$'};
\node [orange] (e) at (1.9,0.75) {`$f$'};
\node (r) at (2.65,0.25) {RR};
\draw[->, thick] (a)--(b);
\draw[->, thick] (b)+(+0.1,0.2) arc (140:-140:.2);
 \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center} 

We now have all the interpretations we'll need. Let's go through it step by step: \begin{enumerate}
	\item  `$\exists x \forall y Qyx$' is true in J iff 
	\item There exists \emph{some} extended interpretation that assigns something to a newly chosen name `$d$' such that `$\forall y Qyd$' is true in it, i.e., iff
	\item Either `$\forall y Qyd$' is true in L or `$\forall y Qyd$' is true in R; ie., iff either
 \begin{enumerate}
		\item `$Qfd$' is true in every interpretation extending L, i.e., iff \begin{enumerate}
			\item `$Qfd$' is true in LL (no); and
			\item `$Qfd$' is true in LR (no).
		\end{enumerate} OR
		\item  `$Qfd$' is true in every interpretation extending R, i.e., iff \begin{enumerate}
			\item `$Qfd$' is true in RL (yes); and
			\item `$Qfd$' is true in RR (yes).
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Since `$Qfd$' is true in both RL and RR, then
	\item `$\forall y Qyd$' is true in R, so that
	\item `$\exists x \forall y Qyx$' is true in J.
\end{enumerate}
All of these interpretations that spawn from our original interpretation share the same domain, and the same extension for `$Q$'. They differ only in that the extended interpretations add new labels to the items in the domain, interpreting the previously unused names. 

Let's try another visual example. Consider this interpretation I, with a domain of three things, an interpreted name `$a$' and two interpreted predicates `$F$' and `$G$'. \begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
    		\draw[rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle (4,2);
    			\node[black] (l) at (0.25,1.8) {I};
    		\node[blue!80!white] (a) at (1,1) {•};
    		\node[black] (la) at (0.79,0.79) {`$a$'};
    		\node[blue!80!white] (b) at (2,1) {•};
    		\node[blue!80!white] (c) at (3,1) {•};
    		\node[black] (F) at (1.5,0.5) {$F$};
    		\node[black] (G) at (2.8,0.8) {$G$};
     		\filldraw[fill=green!20!white, draw =black, fill opacity=0.2] (2,1) ellipse (1.8cm and 0.8cm);
    		\filldraw[fill=yellow!50!white, draw =black, fill opacity=0.2] (3,1) ellipse (0.6cm and 0.45cm);
    	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}	
There are three extended interpretations, II–IV, corresponding to the three ways of adding some unused name `$d$':

We can see that `$\forall x Fx$' is true in I, because in each of II–IV, `$d$' labels something in the `$F$'-region. We can see that `$\forall x Gx$' is false in I, because in II and III, `$d$' labels something not in the `$G$'-region. `$\exists x Gx$' is true in I, because interpretation IV attaches `$d$' to something in the `$G$'-region. 

\section{Formal Truth Conditions for Quantified Sentences}\label{fol.truth.quant}

If you have understood the three examples, and the visual aids, you've understood everything that matters. Strictly speaking, though, we still need to give a precise definition of the truth conditions for quantified sentences. The result, sadly, is a bit ugly, and requires a few new definitions. Brace yourself!

Suppose that \meta{A} is a formula, $\meta{x}$ is a variable, and $\meta{c}$ is a name. We shall write `$\meta{A}\subs{\meta{c}}{\meta{x}}$' to represent the formula that results from replacing or \define{substituting} every free occurrence of $\meta{x}$ in \meta{A} by \meta{c}. So if we began with the formula `$Fxy$', the metalanguage expression ``{`$Fxy$'}$\subs{c}{x}$'' denotes the formula `$Fcy$'. If we began with `$Fyy$', then `$Fyy$'$\subs{c}{x}$ just is the original formula `$Fyy$', since there are no instances of `$x$' in `$Fyy$' to be replaced. If we began with `$Fx \eor \forall x Gx$', then `$Fx \eor \forall x Gx$'$\subs{c}{x}$ is `$Fc \eor \forall x Gx$', since neither occurrence of `$x$' in `$\forall x Gx$' is free.

Suppose we begin with a quantified formula, $\forall \meta{x}\meta{A}$ or $\exists \meta{x}\meta{A}$. If we strip off the quantifier, and pick any name $\meta{c}$, then $\meta{A}\subs{\meta{c}}{\meta{x}}$ is known as a  \define{substitution instance} of the original quantified formulae, and $\meta{c}$ may be called the \define{instantiating name}. So:
	$$\exists x (Rex \eiff Fx)$$
is a substitution instance of 
	$$\forall y \exists x (Ryx \eiff Fx)$$
with the instantiating name `$e$', because  `$\exists x (Ryx \eiff Fx)$'$\subs{e}{y}$ turns out to be `$\exists x (Rex \eiff Fx)$'.

Armed with this notation, the rough idea is as follows. The sentence $\forall \meta{x}\meta{A}$ will be true iff $\meta{A}\subs{\meta{c}}{\meta{x}}$ is true no matter what object (in the domain) we name with $\meta{c}$. Similarly, the sentence $\exists \meta{x}\meta{A}$ will be true iff there is \emph{some} way to assign the name $\meta{c}$ to an object that makes $\meta{A}\subs{\meta{c}}{\meta{x}}$ true. More precisely, we stipulate:\phantomsection\label{quant.tcs.precise}
	\factoidbox{\begin{itemize}
		\item 		$\forall \meta{x}\meta{A}$ is true in an interpretation  iff:\\ 
		$\meta{A}\subs{\meta{c}}{\meta{x}}$ is true in \emph{every} interpretation that extends the original interpretation by assigning an object to some previously uninterpreted name $\meta{c}$ not appearing in $\meta{A}$ (without changing the original interpretation in any other way).
\item		$\exists \meta{x}\meta{A}$ is true in an interpretation  iff:\\
		$\meta{A}\subs{\meta{c}}{\meta{x}}$ is true in \emph{some} interpretation that extends the original interpretation by assigning an object to some previously uninterpreted name $\meta{c}$ not appearing in $\meta{A}$ (without changing the original interpretation in any other way).
	\end{itemize}}
That is: we pick a previously uninterpreted name that doesn't appear in \meta{A}.\footnote{There will always be such a previously uninterpreted name: any given sentence of \FOL\ only contains finitely many names, but \FOL\ has a potentially infinite stock of names to draw from.} We uniformly replace any \emph{free} occurrences of the variable \meta{x} in \meta{A} by our previously uninterpreted name, which creates a substitution instance of `$\forall \meta{x}\meta{A}$' and `$\exists \meta{x}\meta{A}$'. Then if this substitution instance is true on every (respectively, some) way of adding an interpretation of the previously uninterpreted name to our existing interpretation, then `$\forall \meta{x}\meta{A}$' (respectively, `$\exists \meta{x}\meta{A}$') is true on that existing interpretation. 

To be clear: all this is doing is formalising (very pedantically) the intuitive idea expressed above. The result is a bit ugly, and the final definition might look a bit opaque. Hopefully, though, the \emph{spirit} of the idea is clear. 

The trickiest part of all of this is keeping things straight when you have nested quantifiers, particularly quantifiers of different types. As above, when we considered `$\exists y \forall x Qyx$', we needed first to consider interpretations that assigned some new name `$d$', and then, for each of those interpretations, we generate a parasitic family of new interpretations assigning some other new name `$e$'.  If we apply our truth conditions, we can summarise the basic cases of two nested quantifiers as follows: \factoidbox{\begin{itemize}
        \item  $\forall \meta{x} \forall \meta{y} \meta{F}\meta{x}\meta{y}$: This will be true in interpretation $\symfrak{I}$ iff for some new names `$\meta{c}$' and `$\meta{d}$', `$\meta{F}\meta{x}\meta{y}$'$\subs{\meta{c}}{\meta{x}}\subs{\meta{d}}{\meta{y}}$ – i.e., `$\meta{F}\meta{c}\meta{d}$' – is true in every interpretation just like $\symfrak{I}$ except it also assigns extensions to the new names.
        \item $\exists \meta{x} \exists \meta{y} \meta{F}\meta{x}\meta{y}$ is true in $\symfrak{I}$ iff for some new names `$\meta{c}$' and `$\meta{d}$', `$\meta{F}\meta{c}\meta{d}$' is true in some interpretation just like $\symfrak{I}$ except it also assigns extensions to the new names.
        \item $\forall \meta{x} \exists \meta{y} \meta{F}\meta{x}\meta{y}$ is true in $\symfrak{I}$ iff for some new names `$\meta{c}$' and `$\meta{d}$', for each interpretation  $\symfrak{I}'$ (otherwise like $\symfrak{I}$) assigning an extension to `$\meta{c}$' there exists some interpretation $\symfrak{I}''$ assigning an extension to `$\meta{d}$' (and otherwise just like $\symfrak{I}'$) which makes `$\meta{F}\meta{c}\meta{d}$'  true. 
        \item $\exists \meta{x} \forall \meta{y} \meta{F}\meta{x}\meta{y}$ is true in $\symfrak{I}$ iff for some new names `$\meta{c}$' and `$\meta{d}$', there exists some interpretation  $\symfrak{I}'$ (otherwise like $\symfrak{I}$) assigning an extension to `$\meta{c}$' which makes `$\meta{F}\meta{c}\meta{d}$'  true in each interpretation $\symfrak{I}''$ assigning an extension to `$\meta{d}$' and otherwise just like $\symfrak{I}'$.
    \end{itemize}} Note that these rules are listed here for your convenience; they can be derived directly from the stipulation above, so you don't need to learn them separately. 

\section{Pitfalls of Alternative Approaches}

Our rule for evaluating a universal quantifier sentence says $\forall x \meta{A}$ is true in an interpretation $J$ iff $\meta{A}\subs{\meta{c}}{\meta{x}}$ is true in every interpretation just like $J$ except that it assigns an extension to a previously unused name $\meta{c}$. You might be thinking, \emph{this all seems unnecessarily complicated. Can't we do things more simply?} Let's look at some simpler alternatives; we'll see that they go awry.

\paragraph{Why Restrict to New Names?} Here is the first proposed simplification: do away with the requirement for the name in the extended interpretation to be new. That would give us this proposal: \begin{itemize}
	\item $\forall x\meta{A}$ is true in an interpretation $J$ iff $\meta{A}\subs{c}{x}$ is true in any interpretation extending $J$ which assigns an extension to `$c$'. 
\end{itemize}
This only differs from the correct proposal in cases where the name `$c$' is already used. Suppose we consider `$\forall x c=x$'. This is false in any interpretation with two or more things – they can't both be $c$.  But `$c=x$'$\subs{c}{x}$ is just `$c=c$'. And this is true in \emph{every} interpretation which assigns anything to be $c$ at all.  Since `$c=c$' is true in every extended interpretation, this alternative rule \emph{wrongly} predicts `$\forall x c=x$' is true in the original intepretation. The problem arises of course because the name we are substituting for the universally quantified variable interacts with the existing occurences of the name.  The moral: always use a new previously uninterpreted name.




\paragraph{Why not substitute $x$ for $c$?} The truth conditions above start with a quantified sentence, drop the quantifier, and substitute a name for the associated variable. Why do things that way? Couldn't we start by considering the truth values of some sentence with a name across many interpretations, and then swap the name for a variable and add a quantifier? Here is a second proposed alternative: \begin{itemize}
	\item $\forall x \meta{A}\subs{x}{\meta{c}}$ is true in an interpretation $I$ iff in every interpretation just like $I$ except that it interprets a new name \meta{c}, $\meta{A}$ is true.
\end{itemize} 
The problem here is that $\meta{A}$ is actually not well-defined. Consider this case, a sentence with a degenerate initial quantifier: `$\forall x \exists x Rxx$'. The official truth conditions say: this sentence is true iff `$\exists x Rxx$' is true in every extended interpretation that assigns something to a new name. Since `$\exists x Rxx$' has no names, it will be true on all of these extended intepretations iff it is true in the original interpretation. So the initial $\forall x$ quantifier is redundant.

What happens on the alternative approach? It turns out there are several candidates for $\meta{A}$: \begin{enumerate}
	\item $\forall x \exists x Rxx = \forall x \exists x Rxx\subs{x}{\meta{c}}$, so $\meta{A} = \exists x Rxx$;
	\item $\forall x \exists x Rxx = \forall x \exists x Rxc\subs{x}{\meta{c}}$, so $\meta{A} = \exists x Rxc$;
	\item $\forall x \exists x Rxx = \forall x \exists x Rcc\subs{x}{\meta{c}}$, so $\meta{A} = \exists x Rcc$.
\end{enumerate} The problem is, these different candidates for $\meta{A}$ don't all give the same results in a given interpretation. (`$\exists x Rxx$' certainly doesn't always have the same truth value as `$\exists x Rxc$'.) This means that this doesn't actually provide a way of assigning a truth value to a quantified sentence. We need our definition of truth to determine an unambiguous answer, and this proposal doesn't manage to meet that requirement.


\section{Satisfaction} \label{s:Sats} % Æ introduced this

The discussion of truth in §§\ref{fol.truth.atom}–\ref{fol.truth.quant} only ever involved assigning truth values to sentences. When confronted with formulae involving free variables, we altered them by substituting a previously uninterpreted name for the variable, converting it into a sentence, and temporarily extending the interpretation to cover that previously uninterpreted name. This is a significant departure from the definition of truth for \TFL\ sentences in §\ref{s:SchematicTruthTables}. There, we showed how the truth value of a complex \TFL\ sentence in a valuation depended on the truth value of its constituents in that same valuation. By contrast, on the approach just outlined, the truth value of `$\exists x Fx$' in an interpretation depends on the truth value of some other sentence `$Fc$', which is not a constituent of `$\exists x Fx$', in some different (although related) interpretation! 

There is another way to proceed, which allows arbitrary formulae of \FOL, even those with free variables, to be assigned (temporarily) a truth value. This approach can let the truth value of `$\exists x Fx$' in an interpretation depend on the temporary truth value of `$Fx$' in that same interpretation. This is conceptually neater (with no multiplying interpretations) than the approach just introduced, and I present it briefly here as an alternative to the substitutional approach of the preceding sections.

\begin{itemize}
 	\item \emph{This section should be regarded as optional, and only for the dedicated student of logic.}
 \end{itemize} 

The inspiration for the approach comes, once again, from thinking of variables in \FOL\ as behaving like pronouns in English. In §\ref{quant.pron} we gave a gloss of `Someone is angry' as `Some person is such that: they are angry'. Concentrate on `they are angry'. This sentence featuring a bare pronoun doesn't express any specific claim intrinsically. But we can, temporarily, fix a referent for the pronoun `they' – temporarily elevating it to the status of a name. If we do so, the sentence can be evaluated. We can introduce a referent by pointing: `They [points to someone] are angry'. Or we can fix a referent by simply assigning one: `Consider that person over there. They are angry'. If we can find someone or other to temporarily be the referent of the pronoun `they', then it will be true that there is someone such that they are angry. If no matter who we fix as the referent, they are angry, then it will be true that everyone is such that they are angry. 

This is, in a nutshell, the idea we will use to handle quantification in \FOL. Let us introduce some terminology: \factoidbox{
	A \define{variable assignment} over an interpretation is an assignment of exactly one object from the domain of that interpretation to each variable that we care to consider.
}  
If we have an interpretation, and a variable assignment, then we can evaluate every formula of \FOL\ – not only sentences. Of course, the evaluation of the open formulae will be very fragile, since even given a single background interpretation, a formula like `$Fx$' might be true relative to one variable assignment and false relative to another. 

Let us start, as before, by giving rules for evaluating atoms of \FOL, given an interpretation and a variable assignment. \factoidbox{Where $\meta{R}$ is any $n$-place predicate ($n ≥ 0$), and $\meta{t}_{1},…,t_{n}$ are any terms – variables or names, then: \begin{itemize}
	\item  $\meta{R}\meta{t}_{1}…\meta{t}_{n}$ is true on a variable assignment over an interpretation  iff:\\
	$\meta{R}$ is true of the objects assigned to the terms $\meta{t}_{1},…,\meta{t}_{n}$  by that variable assignment and that intepretation, considered in that order.
	\item $\meta{t}_{1}=\meta{t}_{2}$ is true on a variable assignment over an interpretation  iff:\\
	$\meta{t}_{1}$ and $\meta{t}_{2}$ are assigned the very same object by that variable assignment in that interpretation.
\end{itemize}} These are very similar clauses to those we saw for atomic sentences in §\ref{fol.truth.quant}. Indeed, when we are considering atomic sentences of \FOL, the mention of a variable assignment is redundant, since no atomic sentence contains a variable. (If an atom contains a variable, the variable would be free and the formula thus not a sentence.)

The recursion clauses that extend truth for atoms to truth for arbitrary formulae are these (I omit the clauses for $\eor$, $\eif$, and $\eiff$, which you can easily fill in yourself, following the model in §\ref{fol.truth.sent}): \factoidbox{Where \meta{A} and \meta{B} are formulae of \FOL, and \meta{x} is a variable:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\enot \meta{A}$ is true on a variable assignment over an interpretation  iff:\\
		\meta{A} is false on that variable assignment over that interpretation;
		\item $\meta{A} \eand \meta{B}$ is true on a variable assignment over an interpretation  iff:\\
		both \meta{A} is true on that variable assignment over that interpretation and \meta{B} is true on that variable assignment over that interpretation;
		\item …
		\item $\forall \meta{x}\meta{A}$ is is true on a variable assignment over an interpretation  iff:\\
		\meta{A} is true on \emph{every} variable assignment differing from the original one at most in what it assigns to \meta{x} over that interpretation;
		\item $\exists \meta{x}\meta{A}$ is is true on a variable assignment over an interpretation  iff:\\
		\meta{A} is true on \emph{some} variable assignment differing from the original one at most in what it assigns to \meta{x} over that interpretation.
	\end{itemize}
}

The last two clauses are where this approach is strongest. Rather than considering some substitition instance of $\forall\meta{x}\meta{A}$, we simply consider the direct constituent \meta{A}. Rather than considering all variations on the original interpretation which include some previously uninterpreted name, we simply consider all ways of varying what is assigned to \meta{x} by the original variable assignment, but keeping everything else unchanged. If you see the rationale for the clauses offered in §\ref{fol.truth.quant}, you can see why the clauses just offered are appropriate.

We now have the idea of truth on a variable assignment over an intepretation. But what we want – if this alternative approach is to yield the same end result – is truth in an interpretation. Notice that, given an interpretation, varying the variable assignment can change the truth value of a formula with free variables. But it cannot change the truth value of a formula which is a sentence, so if a sentence is true on one variable assignment over an interpretation, it is true on every variable assignment over that interpretation. So we can reintroduce the notion of truth in an intepretation, like so: \factoidbox{
	 \meta{A} is true in an interpretation  iff:\\
	 \meta{A} is a sentence of \FOL, and \meta{A} is true on any (or every) variable assignment over that interpretation.
} 

Here's how this works in practice. Suppose we want to figure out whether the sentence `$\forall x \exists y Lxy$' is true on an interpretation which  associates the two-place predicate `$L$' with the relation `\gap{1} is no heavier than \gap{2}', and has as its domain the planets in our solar system. We might reason as follows: \begin{quote}
	\emph{For each way of picking planets to be the values of `$x$' and `$y$', either we pick two different planets, and one is lighter than the other (no two planets have the same mass); or we pick the same planet, and `they' are identical in mass. In either case, we can always find something no heavier than anything we pick. So for any variable assignment to `$x$' over this interpretation,  we can then assign something to `$y$' so as to make `$Lxy$' true on that joint assignment. Hence no matter what we assign to `$x$', `$\exists y Lxy$' is true on that assignment. But since that is true no matter what we assign to `$x$', `$\forall x \exists y Lxy$' is true on every variable assignment over this interpretation. But that latter is a sentence, so is true in this interpretation.}
\end{quote}

Let us say that a sequence of objects \ntuple{$a_{1}, …, a_{n}$} \define{satisfies} a formula $\meta{A}$ in which the variables $\meta{x}_{1},…,\meta{x}_{n}$ occur freely iff there is a variable assignment over an intepretation whose domain includes each $a_{i}$, and which assigns each $a_{i}$ to the variable $\meta{x}_{i}$, and on which \meta{A} is true over that interpretation. What we have expressed in terms of variable assignments could have been expressed, a little more awkwardly, using the notion of some objects satisfying a formula. Indeed, this is how Alfred Tarski, the inventor of this approach to truth in \FOL, first introduced the idea.\footnote{A translation of his original 1933 paper is Alfred Tarski (1983) `The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages' in his \emph{Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics}, Indianapolis: Hackett, pp.\ 152–278. It is quite technical in places.}

\chapter{Semantic Concepts}\label{FOL.semantics}
Offering a precise definition of truth in \FOL\ was more than a little fiddly. But now that we are done, we can define various central logical notions. These will look very similar to the definitions we offered for \TFL. However, remember that they concern \emph{interpretations}, rather than valuations. 

So:\factoidbox{\begin{itemize}
	\item An \FOL\ sentence $\meta{A}$ is a \define{logical truth} iff $\meta{A}$ is true in every interpretation; this is written  $\entails\meta{A}$.
	\item $\meta{A}$ is a \define{logical falsehood} iff $\meta{A}$ is false in every interpretation; i.e., $\entails\enot\meta{A}$.
	\item Two \FOL\ sentences \meta{A} and \meta{B} are \define{logically equivalent} iff they are true in exactly the same interpretations as each other; i.e., both $\meta{A}\entails\meta{B}$ and $\meta{B}\entails\meta{A}$.
	\item The \FOL\ sentences $\meta{A}_1,\meta{A}_2,…, \meta{A}_n$ are \define{jointly consistent} iff there is some interpretation in which all of the sentences are true. They are \define{jointly inconsistent} iff there is no such interpretation.\end{itemize}}
Some examples might be helpful to illustrate these ideas. 

 Consider the sentences ‘$\forall x(Fx \eor Gx)$’ and ‘$\enot(Fa \eif Ga)$’. I offer an interpretation showing them consistent: \begin{ekey}
	\item[\text{Domain}] musical artists
	\item[F] \gap{1} plays an instrument
	\item[G] \gap{1} sings
	\item[a] Keith Moon
\end{ekey} ‘$Fa$’ is true in this interpretation, while ‘$Ga$’ is false. So the conditional `$(Fa \eif Ga)$' is false, and so `$\enot(Fa \eif Ga)$' is true. Suppose we add a previously unused name $b$ to this interpretation: it will either denote a musician or a singer (I am including producers as playing a musical instrument). So $(Fb \eor Gb)$ will be true in each such extended interpretation. $(Fb \eor Gb)$ is $(Fx \eor Gx)\subs{b}{x}$, so by our semantic clauses, $\forall x (Fx \eor Gx)$ is true in the original interpretation. Since there is an interpretation making each of these sentences true, they are consistent. 

Now look at `$\exists y (Py \eand \enot Py)$'. If this is true in an intepretation, assigning some extension to `$P$', then some interpretation with the same extension assigned to `$P$' and some new name `$b$' makes `$(Pb \eand \enot Pb)$' true. But that can be the case only if the extension of `$b$' is included in the extension of `$P$', and also isn't included in that extension – impossible. So whatever extension we assign to `$P$', `$\exists y (Py \eand \enot Py)$' is false. So that sentence is false on every interpretation, and is a logical falsehood. Its negation is therefore a logical truth: `$\enot \exists y (Py \eand \enot Py)$'. This is entirely general: the negation of a logical truth (falsehood) is a logical falsehood (truth).

Look now at `$\forall x \enot Gx$' and `$\enot \exists x Gx$'. Any interpretation which makes the first true must be such that any extended interpretation with a new name `$b$' makes `$\enot Gb$' true, i.e., any extended interpretation will make `$Gb$' false. Hence, there is no extended interpretation making `$Gb$' true; so `$\exists x Gb$' is false in the original interpretation, hence `$\enot\exists x Gx$' is true. Each step in this line of argument can also be run in reverse; so `$\forall x \enot Gx$' and `$\enot\exists x Gx$' are true in exactly the same interpretations. They are logically equivalent. 


Consider finally `$\forall x Gx$' and `$Ga \eif \exists y (Py \eand \enot Py)$'. These are inconsistent. Any interpretation making `$Ga \eif \exists y(Py \eand \enot Py))$' true must make `$Ga$' false – if it didn't, it would have to make its consequent true, but that's a logical falsehood. But could `$\forall x Gx$' be true in such an interpretation? No – that would require every extended interpretation to make `$Gb$' true, even on the extended interpretation where the new name `$b$' is assigned the same referent as the existing name `$a$', which is not in the extension of `$G$' in this interpretation. So no interpretation can make both of these sentences true.

Given this, any interpretation which makes `$Ga \eif \exists y (Py \eand \enot Py)$' true must make `$\forall x Gx$' false, and must therefore make `$\enot \forall x Gx$' true. So there is no interpretation on which `$Ga \eif \exists y (Py \eand \enot Py)$' is true and in which `$\enot \forall x Gx$' is false.  This is a familiar notion from \TFL: entailment. We will use the symbol `$\entails$' for entailment in \FOL, much as we did for \TFL. This introduces an ambiguity, but a harmless one, since every valid argument in \TFL\ remains a valid argument in \FOL. \factoidbox{$\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, …, \meta{A}_n$ together \define{entail} \meta{C} (written $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, …, \meta{A}_n \entails\meta{C}$) iff \begin{itemize}
\item every interpretation on which all of $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, …, \meta{A}_n$ are true is also one in which \meta{C} is true; or, equivalently, 
	\item there is no interpretation in which all of $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, …, \meta{A}_n$ are true and in which \meta{C} is false.
\end{itemize}} 

These definitions establish a close connection between consistency and entailment, as before: $\meta{A}_{1},…,\meta{A}_{n} \entails \meta{C}$ iff $\meta{A}_{1}$, …, $\meta{A}_{n}$, and $\enot\meta{C}$ are jointly inconsistent. Since joint inconsistency is a property of some sentences collectively, it doesn't actually matter which of them is regarded as `the' conclusion. The truth of all but one of them will force the remaining one to be false, whichever one is chosen. So the joint inconsistency of `$Ga \eif \exists y (Py \eand \enot Py)$' and `$\forall x Gx$' establishes also that $\forall x Gx \entails \enot (Ga \eif \exists y (Py \eand \enot Py))$. 


Also as before, there is a close connection between validity and entailment: \factoidbox{$\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, … \meta{A}_n \ttherefore \meta{C}$ is \define{valid} in \FOL\ iff there is no interpretation in which all of the premises are true and the conclusion is false; i.e., $\meta{A}_1,\meta{A}_2,… \meta{A}_n \entails\meta{C}$. It is \define{invalid} in \FOL\ otherwise.} 
Every possible situation determines some interpretation (assuming it is not possible for there to be nothing at all), since every possible situation will have a domain and its properties and relations will determine extensions on that domain. So whenever there is an entailment, there is no interpretation (and hence no possible situation) making the premise true and the conclusion false. So the argument must be conclusive.

\FOL\ entailments are conclusive in virtue of form, because the consideration of many alternative interpretations of the nonlogical expressions involved means that no argument can be conclusive because of some special `connection in meaning' between such expressions in the language. Entailment in \FOL\ reflects only the logical structure of the sentences involved, where this now includes the new logical resources of \FOL\ over \TFL.

Still, just as with \TFL, there are arguments that are valid in English that aren't symbolised as a valid argument in \FOL. Consider \begin{earg}
\item[] It is raining
\item[So:] It will be that it was raining.
\end{earg} This is conclusive: there is no possible situation in which it is raining now, but in the future it turns out that it never was raining. But the best we can apparently do in quantifier is to symbolise `it is raining' by `$P$', and `it will be that it was raining' by `$Q$', and $P \ttherefore Q$ is not valid in \FOL. If this argument is valid, it will depend on the logic of expressions that are treated as non-logical expressions in \FOL – here, the tenses `is', `was' and `will be'. We will look at this example again briefly in §\ref{s:nextsteps}.

\section{Some Subtleties about Truth and Interpretation} % Æ added

Our interpretations allow us a precise characterisation of formal truth for \FOL. In §\ref{s:Valid}, we introduced the idea of the structure of a sentence, and the pragmatic approach that logicians take to that notion. In \FOL, the logical constants are those of \TFL\ plus the quantifiers and the identity predicate. But every other item of the language is up for reinterpretation, and our interpretations allow us to reinterpret these expressions in an arbitrary fashion.

In \TFL, we were able to characterise a logical truth as a sentence which is actually true on every reinterpretation of nonlogical expressions (in \TFL, the nonlogical expressions are just are the atomic sentences). And we characterised a formally valid argument as one in which each possible reinterpretation (i.e., valuation) of the  premises which makes them actually true, is also one which makes the conclusion actually true.

But this account of formal validity needs refining when it comes to \FOL. Consider the \FOL\ sentence which says that there are at least three things: $$\exists x \exists y \exists z (x≠y \eand x≠z \eand y≠z).$$ This sentence contains no nonlogical expressions. Hence the sentence has a constant meaning, and is true on each reinterpretation just in case it is actually true. It is actually true – there are actually at least three things. Hence our \TFL-inspired account of logical truth would suggest that this sentence is a logical truth. But it seems very strange to think that it is a \emph{logical} truth that there are at least three things. Isn't it possible that there had been fewer? And shouldn't logic allow for that possibility?

The keen-eyed among you will have noticed that this sentence is not, in fact, a logical truth of \FOL. The reason is that in defining truth for sentences of \FOL, we considered not just reinterpretations of the nonlogical expressions, but also we allowed the domain of our interpretation to freely depart from actuality (§\ref{ss.int}). So we are, in effect, allowing our interpretations to vary the meanings of the nonlogical vocabulary \emph{and} to vary the possible situations at which our sentences are to be evaluated. So we can consider a possible situation in which there are just two things, and if that situation provides the domain of an interpretation, there is no way of extending that interpretation to three names `$a$', `$b$', and `$c$' such that `$a≠b \eand a≠c \eand b≠c$' is true; hence `$\exists x \exists y \exists z (x≠y \eand x≠z \eand y≠z)$' isn't true on the original interpretation.

One sentence of this class is nevertheless a logical truth: the claim that something exists, `$\exists x x=x$'. Since it is a constraint on \FOL\ domains that they cannot be empty (§\ref{sec_domains}), there is for any interpretation a way of adding a previously uninterpreted name `$c$' which denotes an object in the domain, and of course `$c=c$' is true in that extended interpretation, since each name must have a referent in any interpretation, and the identity predicate is always interepreted as representing pairs of objects in the domain and themselves.

This appeal to possible situations is very suggestive. Every possible situation seems to have a domain of things which exist in that possibility, and the properties and relations that are instantiated in that possibility determine extensions drawn from that domain. So you might wonder: should we think of interpretations as just being `possible worlds'? Should we, that is, think that a sentence \meta{A} is consistent (i.e., there is an interpretation on which it is true) iff \meta{A} is true in some possible situation?

We should not. In \FOL\ it is not even clear how to do this, because a sentence like `$\exists x (Fx \eand Gx)$' doesn't even seem to mean anything without a prior intepretation. If we assign a meaning to `$F$' and `$G$', we can then see if there are possible situations making the sentence true. The problem then will be that there are logically consistent sentences that are true in no possible world. For example, suppose we interpret `$F$' to be `\gap{} is a cat' and `$G$' to be `\gap{} is a mineral'. Obviously, given these asssignments of meaning, the sentence can be rendered in English as `there is a cat which is a mineral', and that is impossible: I would assume that it is of the essence of a cat that it be a living animal, not an inanimate mineral. But the sentence is perfectly consistent despite being impossible, precisely consistency involves reinterpreting the predicates so that they can possibly hold together. There is a significant difference between possibility and consistency: \begin{itemize}
	\item Possibility is about the meaning of an already interpreted sentence: holding that meaning fixed, is there a possible situation which it describes?
	\item Consistency is about logical structure, according to some language: holding that structure fixed, is there a way to assign a meaning to the non-structural expressions to make the sentence come out true?
\end{itemize} This distinction is not always noted. Philosophers are prone to talking of `logical possibility' where they generally mean to talk about consistency. Possibility, as I understand it, is a property of intepreted sentences, or propositions. Logical consistency is a property of interpretable sentences, relative to some language in which they are assigned a meaning. In this sense, the logical `languages' \TFL\ and \FOL\ are more like proto-languages, because only a select few of the expressions of the language are antecedently meaningful.\footnote{I owe my understanding of this point to the distinction between `representational' and `interpretational' semantics drawn by John Etchemendy (1999) \emph{The Concept of Logical Consequence}, CSLI Publications, chs. 2–5.}

\keyideas{
	\item Definitions of entailment, consistency, logical falsehood and logical equivalence can be given for \FOL\ that are very close parallels to those for \TFL, though given in terms of intepretations not valuations.
	\item The notion of a logical truth in \FOL\ is slightly different than the notion of a logical truth in \TFL, since we allow interpretations that vary not just in what they assign as extensions to the nonlogical vocabulary, but also variation in the domain over which quantifiers range. Nothing like the latter feature occurs in \TFL\ valuations, but it is crucial for ensuring that contingent counting sentences, without names or nonlogical predicates, aren't misclassified as logical truths. Consistency must be distinguished from possibility.

\section{Logical Truths and Logical Falsehoods}
Suppose we want to show that `$\exists xAxx \eif Bd$' is \emph{not} a logical truth. This requires showing that the sentence is not true in every interpretation; i.e.,\ that it is false in some interpretation. If we can provide just one interpretation in which the sentence is false, then we will have shown that the sentence is not a logical truth.

In order for `$\exists xAxx \eif Bd$' to be false, the antecedent (`$\exists x Axx$') must be true, and the consequent (`$Bd$') must be false. To construct such an interpretation, we start by specifying a domain. Keeping the domain small makes it easier to specify what the predicates will be true of, so we shall start with a domain that has just one member. For concreteness, let's say it is the city of Paris. 
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[\domain] Paris
	\end{ekey}
The name `$d$' must name something in the domain, so we have no option but:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[d] Paris
	\end{ekey}
Recall that we want `$\exists x Axx$' to be true, so we want all members of the domain to be paired with themselves in the extension of `$A$'. We can offer:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[A] \gap{1} is in the same place as \gap{2}
	\end{ekey}
Now `$Add$' is true, so it is surely true that `$\exists x Axx$'. Next, we want `$Bd$' to be false, so the referent of `$d$' must not be in the extension of `$B$'. We might simply offer:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[B] \gap{1} is in Germany
	\end{ekey}
Now we have an interpretation where `$\exists x Axx$' is true, but where `$Bd$' is false. So there is an interpretation where `$\exists x Axx \eif Bd$' is false. So `$\exists x Axx \eif Bd$' is not a logical truth.

We can just as easily show that `$\exists xAxx \eif Bd$' is not a logical falsehood. We need only specify an interpretation in which `$\exists xAxx \eif Bd$' is true; i.e., an interpretation in which either `$\exists x Axx$' is false or `$Bd$' is true. Here is one:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[\domain] Paris
		\item[d] Paris
		\item[A] \gap{1} is in the same place as \gap{2}
		\item[B] \gap{1} is in France
	\end{ekey}
This shows that there is an interpretation where `$\exists xAxx \eif Bd$' is true. So `$\exists x Axx \eif Bd$' is not a logical falsehood.

\section{Logical Equivalence}
Suppose we want to show that `$\forall x Sx$' and `$\exists x Sx$' are not logically equivalent. We need to construct an interpretation in which the two sentences have different truth values; we want one of them to be true and the other to be false. We start by specifying a domain. Again, we make the domain small so that we can specify extensions easily. In this case, we shall need at least two objects. (If we chose a domain with only one member, the two sentences would end up with the same truth value. In order to see why, try constructing some partial interpretations with one-member domains.) For concreteness, let's take:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[\domain] Ornette Coleman, Sarah Vaughan
	\end{ekey}
We can make `$\exists x Sx$' true by including something in the extension of `$S$', and we can make `$\forall x Sx$' false by leaving something out of the extension of `$S$'. For concreteness we shall offer:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[S] \gap{1} plays saxophone
	\end{ekey}
Now `$\exists x Sx$' is true, because `$S$' is true of Ornette Coleman. Slightly more precisely, extend our interpretation by allowing `$c$' to name Ornette Coleman.  `$Sc$' is true in this extended interpretation, so `$\exists x Sx$' was true in the original interpretation. Similarly, `$\forall x Sx$' is false, because `$S$' is false of Sarah Vaughan. Slightly more precisely, extend our interpretation by allowing `$d$' to name Sarah Vaughan, and `$Sd$' is false in this extended interpretation, so `$\forall x Sx$' was false in the original interpretation. We have provided a counter-interpretation to the claim that `$\forall x Sx$' and `$\exists x Sx$' are logically equivalent.
	\factoidbox{

	}

\section{Validity, Entailment and Consistency}
To test for validity, entailment, or consistency, we typically need to produce interpretations that determine the truth value of several sentences simultaneously. 

Consider the following argument in \FOL:
$$\exists x(Gx \eif Ga) \ttherefore \exists x Gx \eif Ga$$
To show that this is invalid, we must make the premise true and the conclusion false. The conclusion is a conditional, so to make it false, the antecedent must be true and the consequent must be false. Clearly, our domain must contain two objects. Let's try:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[\domain] Karl Marx, Ludwig von Mises
		\item[G] \gap{1} hated communism
		\item[a] Karl Marx
	\end{ekey}
Given that Marx wrote \emph{The Communist Manifesto}, `$Ga$' is plainly false in this interpretation. But von Mises famously hated communism. So `$\exists x Gx$' is true in this interpretation. Hence `$\exists x Gx \eif Ga$' is false, as required. 

But does this interpretation make the premise true? Yes it does! For `$\exists x (Gx \eif Ga)$' to be true,  `$Gc \eif Ga$' must be true in  some extended interpretation that is almost exactly like the interpretation just given, except that it also interprets some previously uninterpreted name `$c$'. Let's extend our original interpretation by letting `$c$' denote Karl Marx – the same thing as `$a$' denotes in the original interpretation. Since `$a$' and `$c$' denote the same thing in the extended interpretation, obviously `$Gc \eif Ga$' will be true. So `$\exists x (Gx \eif Ga)$' is true in the original interpretation. So the premise is true, and the conclusion is false, in this original interpretation. The argument is therefore invalid. 

In passing, note that we have also shown that `$\exists x(Gx \eif Ga)$' does \emph{not} entail `$\exists x Gx \eif Ga$'. And equally, we have shown that the sentences `$\exists x (Gx \eif Ga)$' and `$\enot (\exists x Gx \eif Ga)$' are jointly consistent.

Let's consider a second example. Consider:
	$$\forall x \exists y Lxy \ttherefore \exists y \forall x Lxy$$
Again, I want to show that this is invalid. To do this, we must make the premises true and the conclusion false. Here is a suggestion:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[\domain] People with a living biological sibling
		\item[L] \gap{1} shares a parent with \gap{2}
	\end{ekey}
The premise is clearly true on this interpretation. Anyone in the domain has a living sibling. That sibling will also, then, be in the domain, because one cannot be someone's sibling without also having  them as a sibling. So for everyone in the domain, there will be at least one other person in the domain who is their sibling, and thus has a parent in common with them. Hence `$\forall x \exists y Lxy$' is true. But the conclusion is clearly false, for that would require that there is some single person who shares a parent with everyone in the domain, and there is no such person. So the argument is invalid. We observe immediately that the sentences `$\forall x \exists y Lxy$' and `$\enot\exists y \forall x Lxy$' are jointly consistent and that `$\forall x \exists y Lxy$' does not entail `$\exists y \forall x Lxy$'. 

For my third example, I will mix things up a bit. In §\ref{s:Interpretations}, I described how we can present some interpretations using diagrams. For example:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (atom1) at (0,1.5) {1};
\node (atom2) at (2,1.5) {2};
\node (atom3) at (2,0) {3};
\draw[->, thick] (atom1) .. controls (1,1.75) .. (atom2);
\draw[->, thick] (atom1) .. controls (1,0.5) .. (atom3);
\draw[->, thick] (atom1)+(-0.15,0.15) arc (-330:-30:.3); 
\draw[->, thick] (atom2)  .. controls (2.2,0.75) .. (atom3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Using the conventions employed in §\ref{s:Interpretations}, the domain of this interpretation is the first three positive whole numbers, and `$R$' is true of \meta{x} and \meta{y} just in case there is an arrow from \meta{x} to \meta{y} in our diagram. Here are some sentences that the interpretation makes true:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item `$\forall x \exists y Ryx$' 
		\item `$\exists x \forall y Rxy$' \hfill witness 1
		\item `$\exists x \forall y (Ryx \eiff x = y)$' \hfill witness 1
		\item `$\exists x \exists y \exists z (\enot y = z \eand Rxy \eand Rzx)$' \hfill witness 2
		\item `$\exists x \forall y \enot Rxy$' \hfill witness 3
		\item `$\exists x (\exists y Ryx \eand \enot \exists y Rxy)$' \hfill witness 3
	\end{itemize}
This immediately shows that all of the preceding six sentences are jointly consistent. We can use this observation to generate \emph{invalid} arguments, e.g.:
	\begin{align*}
		\forall x \exists y Ryx, \exists x \forall y Rxy  &\ttherefore  \forall x \exists y Rxy\\
		\exists x \forall y Rxy, \exists x \forall y \enot Rxy & \ttherefore \enot \exists x \exists y \exists z (\enot y = z \eand Rxy \eand Rzx)
	\end{align*}
and many more besides.

	\factoidbox{
	To show that $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, …, \meta{A}_n \ttherefore \meta{C}$ is invalid, it suffices to find an interpretation where all of $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, …, \meta{A}_n$ are true and where $\meta{C}$ is false.
	
	That same interpretation will show that $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, …, \meta{A}_n$ do not entail $\meta{C}$.
	
	That same interpretation will show that $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, …, \meta{A}_n, \enot \meta{C}$ are jointly consistent.}
When you provide an interpretation to refute a claim – that some sentence is a logical truth, say – this is sometimes called providing a \define{countermodel}.

\section{Logical Truths and Logical Falsehoods}
We can show that a sentence is \emph{not} a logical truth just by providing one carefully specified interpretation: an interpretation in which the sentence is false. To show that something is a logical truth, on the other hand, it would not be enough to construct ten, one hundred, or even a thousand interpretations in which the sentence is true. A sentence is only a logical truth if it is true in \emph{every} interpretation, and there are infinitely many interpretations. We need to reason about all of them, and we cannot do this by dealing with them one by one!

Sometimes, we can reason about all interpretations fairly easily. For example, we can offer a relatively simple argument that `$Raa\eiff Raa$' is a logical truth:
	\begin{quote}
		\label{allmodels1}
		Any relevant interpretation will give `$Raa$' a truth value. If `$Raa$' is true in an interpretation, then `$Raa \eiff Raa$' is true in that interpretation. If `$Raa$' is false in an interpretation, then `$Raa \eiff Raa$' is true in that interpretation. These are the only alternatives. So `$Raa \eiff Raa$' is true in every interpretation. Therefore, it is a logical truth.
	\end{quote}
This argument is valid, of course, and its conclusion is true. However, it is not an argument in \FOL. Rather, it is an argument in English \emph{about} \FOL: it is an argument in the metalanguage. 

Note another feature of the argument. Since the sentence in question contained no quantifiers, we did not need to think about how to interpret `$a$' and `$R$'; the point was just that, however we interpreted them, `$Raa$' would have some truth value or other. (We could ultimately have given the same argument concerning \TFL\ sentences.)

Here is another bit of reasoning. Consider the sentence `$\forall x(Rxx\eiff Rxx)$'. Again, it should obviously be a logical truth. But to say precisely why is quite a challenge. We cannot say that `$Rxx \eiff Rxx$' is true in every interpretation, since `$Rxx \eiff Rxx$' is not even a \emph{sentence} of \FOL\ (remember that `$x$' is a variable, not a name). So we have to be a bit cleverer. 
	\begin{quote}
		Consider some arbitrary interpretation. Consider some arbitrary member of the model's domain, which, for convenience, we shall call \emph{obbie}, and suppose we extend our original interpretation by adding a previously uninterpreted name, `$c$', to name \emph{obbie}. Then either `$Rcc$' will be true or it will be false. If `$Rcc$' is true, then `$Rcc \eiff Rcc$' is true. If `$Rcc$' is false, then `$Rcc \eiff Rcc$' will be true. So either way, `$Rcc \eiff Rcc$' is true. Since there was nothing special about \emph{obbie} – we might have chosen any object – we see that no matter how we extend our original interpretation by allowing `$c$' to name some new object, `$Rcc \eiff Rcc$' will be true in the new interpretation. So `$\forall x (Rxx \eiff Rxx)$' was true in the original interpretation. But we chose our interpretation arbitrarily. So `$\forall x (Rxx \eiff Rxx)$' is true in every interpretation. It is therefore a logical truth.
	\end{quote}
This is quite longwinded, but, as things stand, there is no alternative. In order to show that a sentence is a logical truth, we must reason about \emph{all} interpretations. 

But sometimes we can draw a conclusion about some way all interpretations must be, by considering a hypothetical interpretation which isn't that way, and showing that hypothesis leads to trouble. Here is an example. \begin{quote}
	Suppose there were an interpretation which makes `$a≠b \eif \enot \exists x(x=a \eand x=b)$' false. Then while `$a≠b$' is true on that interpretation, `$\enot \exists x(x=a \eand x=b)$' must be false. So `$\exists x(x=a \eand x=b)$' must be true; and hence it has some true substitition instance with some previously uninterpreted name `$c$' as the instantiating name: `$c=a \eand c=b$' is true. But then it must also be that `$a=b$' is true, which contradicts our original supposition that `$a≠b$' is true on this intepretation. So there can be no such interpretation, and hence the sentence cannot be false on any interpretation and must be a logical truth.
\end{quote} This is an example of \idefine{reductio} reasoning\phantomsection\label{reductio}: we assume something, and derive some absurdity or contradiction; we then conclude that our assumption is to be rejected. It is often easier to show that all Fs have a property by deriving an absurdity from the assumption that some F lacks the property, than it is to show it `directly' by considering each F in turn. This is a powerful technique, used widely in mathematics and elsewhere.

\section{Other Cases}
Similar points hold of other cases too. Thus, we must reason about all interpretations if we want to show:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item that a sentence is a logical falsehood; for this requires that it is false in \emph{every} interpretation. 
		\item that two sentences are logically equivalent; for this requires that they have the same truth value in \emph{every} interpretation.
		\item that some sentences are jointly inconsistent; for this requires that there is no interpretation in which all of those sentences are true together; i.e., that, in \emph{every} interpretation, at  least one of those sentences is false.
		\item that an argument is valid; for this requires that the conclusion is true in \emph{every} interpretation where the premises are true. 
		\item that some sentences entail another sentence.
	\end{itemize}
The problem is that, with the tools available to you so far, reasoning about all interpretations is a serious challenge! Let's take just one more example. Here is an argument which is obviously valid:
	$$\forall x(Hx \eand Jx) \ttherefore \forall x Hx$$
After all, if everything is both H and J, then everything is H. But we can only show that the argument is valid by considering what must be true in every interpretation in which the premise is true. And to show this, we would have to reason as follows:
	\begin{quote}
		Consider an arbitrary interpretation in which the premise `$\forall x(Hx \eand Jx)$' is true. It follows that, however we expand the interpretation with a previously uninterpreted name, for example `$c$', `$Hc \eand Jc$' will be true in this new interpretation. `$Hc$' will, then, also be true in this new interpretation. But since this held for \emph{any} way of expanding the interpretation, it must be that `$\forall x Hx$' is true in the old interpretation. And we assumed nothing about the interpretation except that it was one in which `$\forall x(Hx \eand Jx)$'  is true. So any interpretation in which `$\forall x(Hx \eand Jx)$' is true is one in which `$\forall x Hx$' is true. The argument is valid!
\end{quote}
Even for a simple argument like this one, the reasoning is somewhat complicated. For longer arguments, the reasoning can be extremely torturous.

\emph{Reductio} reasoning is particularly useful in demonstrating the validity of valid arguments. In that case we will typically make the hypothetical supposition that there is some interpretation which makes the premises true and the conclusion false, and then derive an absurdity from that supposition. From that we can conclude there is no such intepretation, and hence that any interpretation which makes the premises true must also be one which makes the conclusion true. 

The following table summarises whether a single (counter-)interpretation suffices, or whether we must reason about all interpretations (whether directly considering them all, or indirectly making use of \emph{reductio}).


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \toprule 
%\cline{2-3}
 & \textbf{Yes} & \textbf{No}\\
 \midrule

\bottomrule \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{table.ModelOrArgument}
This might usefully be compared with the table at the end of §\ref{s:directPartialTruthTable}. The key difference resides in the fact that \TFL\ concerns truth tables, whereas \FOL\ concerns interpretations. This difference is deeply important, since each truth-table only ever has finitely many lines, so that a complete truth table is a relatively tractable object. By contrast, there are infinitely many interpretations for any given sentence(s), so that reasoning about all interpretations can be a deeply tricky business. 

\keyideas{
	\item To demonstrate that something is a logical truth or a logical falsehood, or that an argument is an entailment, involves reasoning about all intepretations.
	\item Reasoning about all intepretations of a given sentence is intrinsically more difficult than reasoning about all valuations, because there are only finitely many valuations to consider for any \TFL\ sentence, but infinitely many intepretations for an \FOL\ sentence.
	\item Some indirect strategies, like \emph{reductio}, can be very useful in overcoming this obstacle.
