`forall`$x$ Adelaide
====================

This is a derivative work created by [Antony Eagle](https://antonyeagle.org), based upon [Tim Button](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytbu/index.html)'s 2016 Cambridge version of [PD Magnus](https://www.fecundity.com/job/)'s forall*x* (version 1.29). There are pervasive substantive changes in content, theoretical approach, coverage, and appearance – it's fair to say no one will mistake this version for Magnus' original.
