Forall*x* Adelaide
==================

This is a derivative work created by [Antony Eagle](https://antonyeagle.org), based upon [Tim Button](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytbu/index.html)'s 2016 Cambridge version of [PD Magnus](https://www.fecundity.com/job/)'s forall*x* (version 1.29). There are pervasive substantive changes in content, theoretical approach, coverage, and appearance – it's fair to say no one will mistake this version for Magnus' original.

Current issues and proposed revisions
-------------------------------------

This text is approaching stability, yet remains under active, albeit sometimes intermittent, revision. The current public version of the text will be variable for the remainder of 2021, as it is being presently revised to serve as a textbook for the Summer 2022 iteration of our *Introduction to Logic* course. This is likely (hopefully!) the last major revision of the text. 

I welcome comments, notification of errors and typos, and any new ideas: [antony.eagle@adelaide.edu.au](mailto:antony.eagle@adelaide.edu.au?subject=forallx-adl). I will update this readme with a list of issues and proposed changes even while teaching from the book, but I will not push changes to the pdf and source until a given course has been delivered and assessed. 

The following list contains current issues and proposed revisions arranged by chapter, most as rather cryptic notes to myself.

* Chapter 1 (`forallx-adl-what.tex`) 
* Chapter 2 (`forallx-adl-tfl.tex`)
* Chapter 3 (`forallx-adl-truthtables.tex`)
* Chapter 4 (`forallx-adl-fol.tex`)
* Chapter 5 (`forallx-adl-interpretations.tex`)
* Chapter 6 (`forallx-adl-prooftfl.tex`)
* Chapter 7 (`forallx-adl-prooffol.tex`)
	- §39 
		* some ideas about where next in logic
* Backmatter
