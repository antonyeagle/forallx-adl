Current issues and proposed revisions
-------------------------------------

This text is approaching stability, yet remains under active, albeit intermittent, revision. The current public version of the text is stable for summer term 2020, as it is being used as a textbook in our *Introduction to Logic* course. 

I welcome comments, notification of errors and typos, and any new ideas: [antony.eagle@adelaide.edu.au](mailto:antony.eagle@adelaide.edu.au?subject=forallx-adl). I will update this readme with a list of issues and proposed changes. But I will not push changes until the course is over. 

The following list contains current issues and proposed revisions arranged by chapter:

* Chapter 1 (`forallx-adl-what.tex`) 
* Chapter 2 (`forallx-adl-tfl.tex`)
	-§4
		- Practice questions in §4;
		- add discussion of sentence structure and trees, to illustrate multiple ways of dividing a sentence.
		- the idea of a 'canonical clause' (Huddleston & Pullum, pp. 24–5) and the idea of an atomic sentence. But, again, the choice of strutural words influences this – 'always, bob is tall' is a non-canonical clause but it is \TFL-atomic.
	- §5
		- 'only if' as 'then'
		- add more remarks on paraphrase – what makes a paraphrase acceptable, ' Since there are important grammatical differences that are argumentatively insignificant, logic will sometimes overlook linguistic accuracy in order to capture the ‘spirit’ of a sentence.'
		- Add a section on modelling and the absence of nuance – how we are attempting to model, not translate. Link forward to later discussion in §8.3.
	- §7
		-  more clarity around quasi-quotation. e.g., if $\mathcal{A}$ is '$A$', $\neg\mathcal{A}$ just is '$\neg A$'. more practice exercises. 	 
* Chapter 3 (`forallx-adl-truthtables.tex`)
	- §8
		+ §8.1: introduce the idea of a function in general.
		+ exercises!
	- §11
		+ Add a discussion of using the test for entailment to understand NL arguments.
		+ §11.5: two kinds of limits: valid arguments not captured (remedied by \FOL), invalid NL arguments misclassified due to inadequate symbolisation – a form that looks like it might be captured by \TFL\ but which in fact isn't.
	- §13
		+ add discussion of how to handle disjunction, biconditionals in partial truth tables.
		+ Add discussion of how partial truth tables must be constructed with a particular semantic property in mind: that is what determines the starting assumption about truth values that we will make (e.g., using them to assess consistency one begins with `assume all Ts` – but not when using them to assess non-contradictoriness).
* Chapter 4 (`forallx-adl-fol.tex`)
* Chapter 5 (`forallx-adl-interpretations.tex`)
* Chapter 6 (`forallx-adl-prooftfl.tex`)
	- §26
		+ Need a practice exercise
		+ add some discussion of epistemology of reasoning – validity is not sufficient for good reasoning, even if it is necessary.
* Chapter 7 (`forallx-adl-prooffol.tex`)
* Backmatter
