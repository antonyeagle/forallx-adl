Forall*x* Adelaide
==================

This is a derivative work created by [Antony Eagle](https://antonyeagle.org), based upon [Tim Button](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytbu/index.html)'s 2016 Cambridge version of [PD Magnus](https://www.fecundity.com/job/)'s forall*x* (version 1.29). There are pervasive substantive changes in content, theoretical approach, coverage, and appearance â€“ it's fair to say no one will mistake this version for Magnus' original.

Current issues and proposed revisions
-------------------------------------

As of early 2022, this text is now broadly stable. I do not envisage making substantive further changes in the near future.

I welcome comments, notification of errors and typos, and any new ideas: [antony.eagle@adelaide.edu.au](mailto:antony.eagle@adelaide.edu.au?subject=forallx-adl). I will update this readme with a list of issues and proposed changes even while teaching from the book, but I will not push major changes to the pdf and source until a given course has been delivered and assessed. (I will tacitly correct typos and small errors.)


Current known issues or proposed changes to the text:

* Clarify discussion of parentheses conventions to ensure no impression given that $A \wedge B$ is a sentence, only that the sentence $(A \wedge B)$ can be unambiguously reconstructed from it.
